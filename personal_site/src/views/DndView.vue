    <div class="main-text intro-text">
      <p>I run D&amp;D pretty much everywhere I go, as it&#39;s one of my favourite and deepest passions. A table-top
        roleplaying game is unlike anything else, a piece of live theatre, boardgame, and creative co-operative story
        telling all in one. I never can find the words to describe it properly.
      </p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been running it for over 10 years since I was 16, and by far the most popular system at my tables has
        been Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. My world building project I call 'The Materiae Existantiae' is my
        go to setting for it, and itself was built around the assumed setting that D&amp;D functions around.</p>
      <p>For players in my games, this page is a starting point of any campaign for them to dig into the slight changes
        I often use, and for any visitors I hope it can give you ideas and perhaps even introduce you to some new and
        exciting content. While I use the base game mostly as is, I have this following collection of homebrew that I
        have
        curated from the internet or on occasion come up with myself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="master-player-brief" class="subtitle">Master Player Brief</h2>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>This is the master brief, the default applicable rules I run on top of D&amp;D 5th Edition, regardless of
        setting. Some setting specific modifications may be made, and I would tell you about those.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="official-material-i-run" class="subsubtitle">Official Material I run:</h3>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>All D&amp;D 5e official WoTC printed books, including those that come out in the future (PHB, SCAG,
        Xanathar&#39;s, etc). I run Unearthed Arcana material on an open trial basis, where I retain the right to modify
        or remove UA material if it becomes an issue. With regards to the Class Variant Features UA the ‘Spell
        Versatility’ features are not allowed, as they break my in-universe laws of magic. UA that is considered
        retired,
        such as those since the release of Tasha’s, I don’t allow by default (though as usual you can ask).
      </p>
      <p>If there&#39;s something from 3rd Party, or Homebrew you desperately want please run it by me first. I&#39;m
        not
        just going to say no.

      <p>The following collection of vetted-by-me homebrew (subject to oversight and at-the-table balancing). The only
        homebrew that replaces default rules is Weapons Revised, which provides a more balanced, nuanced and slight
        power up to weapons and weapon users, so please at least skim it. It is marked with an asterisk *.
      </p>

      <p>The compendiums are high-quality compilations of whole swathes of options in the style of Xanathar’s, and I do
        recommend taking a peek if you want to try something new or are looking for novel character ideas. I also would
        love to playtest them, so there’s that too. </p>

        the feel of it. Characters who have
        had their soul bonded to a tree by a powerful fey start to become dryads, and as they indulge in their new
        nature, they grow into the powers described within. This is a &quot;Prestige Class&quot; that only goes up to
        level 10 and is intended to be taken through multiclassing. You may take dryad as your first level, perhaps that
        is indeed how your adventuring career started. </p>

    <h3 id="personal-homebrew-rules" class="subsubtitle">Personal Homebrew Rules</h3>
    <div class="main-text">
      <p>We will be playing with all the optional rules we all take for granted, like feats, background variants,
        multiclassing and flanking. In addition, we will play with my personal homebrew rules, a list of small rules
        tweaks and additions. Rules marked with an asterisk * are important to normal character creation;
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Accessing Bags and Items</span> – accessing any bags, packs, or items not stored
        in purposefully easily accessible
        locations, such as a purpose-built pocket, a bandoleer, a holster, or a sheath (or so on), is an action, as you
        take off a bag, rummage around in it, withdraw the item, and put the bag back on (or equivalent). Such items, in
        particular potions of healing, do not fit in normal pockets, though certain custom-made holsters may do the
        trick. Accessing any items in purposefully easily accessible locations like this is instead a bonus action.
      </p>
      <p>The act of consuming or administering any potion/poison/etc., like normal drinking, is considered part of the
        action / bonus action. Items that are used as an action, such as a medical kit or trap, are not accessed as part
        of their use action, so be prepared.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Background Feat &amp; Normal+ Humans*</span> – you pick one feat at character
        creation, as if you have a character level of 1 (but otherwise classless), in addition to normal character
        creation. However, this feat must be related to your background, such as Skulker for the Criminal background.
        This can be any available feat as allowed by the core or expanded rules, such as Prestigious D&amp;D&#39;s
        Secondary Swap out. Because of this, the variant human is not available. Instead you&#39;re a &quot;Normal
        Human+&quot;, using the non-variant human plus an additional Skill Proficiency of your choice and an additional
        Tool Proficiency of your choice.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Cultural Languages* </span>– There are no racial languages, but cultural
        languages in their stead, such as Imperial
        Common. Characters grow up speaking their culture&#39;s language, and the setting’s Common if their home culture
        is not that. Additional ‘racial’ languages are instead additional cultural languages. Knowledge of language
        comes
        from culture and nurture, not from blood. That said, exotic languages (such as draconic) are considered an
        aspect
        of magic, and (like normal) may not be taken as a ‘racial’ language without DM consent. See the
        &#39;Languages&#39; section of the setting for details and the various cultural languages.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Flanking, battlemat </span>– almost as described in the Player Handbook, whenever
        a friendly creature is on the
        opposite
        side of an enemy (I.e. a line can be drawn between you two bisecting the enemy through opposite sides or
        corners),
        both friendly creatures have advantage to attack that enemy. However, flanking cannot be earned on creatures two
        or more sizes larger than you.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Flanking, theatre of the mind </span>– when engaging a creature in melee you are
        said to be ‘facing’ that creature.
        When attacking a creature in melee who is not facing you, you gain advantage due to flanking. Creatures not
        already
        engaged automatically ‘face’ the incoming attacker. At the end of the turn creatures declare who they face until
        the start of their next turn, if not immediately obvious. Players with the Extra Attack feature and creatures
        with Multi-attack can face a number of creatures at once equal to their total number of attacks (effectively
        requiring a number of attackers equal to their attacks for an additional attacker to gain advantage from
        flanking).
        Creatures two or more sizes smaller do not impose flanking.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Hitting Cover</span> – Ranged attacks against creatures in cover hit the cover if
        the player rolls the cover value or below on the dice (so 2/1 for half cover and 5 or below in three quarter
        cover). Creatures in 5ft with creatures of their size or larger are treated as being in half cover (+2 bonus to
        AC) by their enemy, meaning creatures in melee provide cover for each other. Creatures in 5ft with creatures two
        sizes larger are in three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC). Don’t shoot your allies now!
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Improved Standard Array* </span>– we will be using my version of the standard
        array. I find the original a little
        underwhelming for Heroic Adventuring, and also poorly balanced between odd and even values. So, we will use;
        16, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9
        This array also modifies the total points for those using Point Buy to 30. Feel free to use the calculator below
        to help you out if using Point Buy instead.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Injury Risk </span>– when a character goes unconscious in a fight, next to their
        death saves, they tally a mark, an
        &quot;injury risk&quot;. At the end of the fight characters that have injury risks make a constitution saving
        throw vs a DC equal to the number of risks x5 (so one risk is a DC 5, two risks DC 10, etc.) and erase the
        marks.
        If they fail, their temporary harms develop into a permanent injury, and they roll on the injury table found on
        page 272 of the DMG, otherwise the risk abates and they suffered only temporary wounds. Depending on the injury,
        the DM in collaboration with the players may adjudicate a different permanent injury.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Skill Per Intelligence*</span> – intelligence is one of the weakest statistics
        mechanically, leading many to take it as a dump statistic and shoe-horning their character to be played as a
        dumbass (though sometimes this can be fun, no mistake, it should be a choice not a compromise). In an attempt to
        reconnect Intelligence to Skills, their old
        domain, and boost its worth; when creating a character, you select a number of skills from your class’ skill
        list equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier (to a total minimum of 0), not the number stated.
      </p>
      <p>In the unlikely situation where high level rogues or bards find themselves with more expertise than skills,
        they can instead take a skill proficiency.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Sprinting &amp; Chasing</span> – you can spend your movement, action and bonus
        action (your entire “turn”) to move 5 times your speed in a straight line, provoking opportunity attacks as
        normal. Movement in 5e is “combat
        movement”, a sort of situationally aware movement, which is why when you run the numbers it seems slow. This
        sprint, then, is an all-out reckless sprint.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, chases and chasing another creature is a skill challenge and is not invalidated by the speed value
        of one creature being greater than another’s. Large speed differences can grant advantages/disadvantages to
        certain rolls depending on how the player has their character interact with the chase, but otherwise
        characters in combat &quot;Movement&quot; value doesn&#39;t affect chases.
      </p>
      <p><span class="inline-subtitle">Unstable Platform </span>– when shooting from an unstable platform, such as
        quicksand, the back of a moving mount
        (horse, broomstick etc) or when actively flying (i.e. not with the fly or levitate spells, or similar), you make
        ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks that have somatic components with disadvantage. This rule creates
        the feat “Mounted Archery”. See the Materium Existantiae Core Setting document for details. </p>
      <br>
      <p>*With your 1st level feat you could choose to take as your feat (instead of from the normal and expanded feat
        lists) one of the secondary features listed below from the other classes which you qualify for (as per the
        Prestigious D&amp;D rules);
