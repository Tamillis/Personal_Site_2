### Welcome to the Materiae Existentiae Wiki! 

The MEW is an online repository for my worldbuilding project I call the 'Materium Existentiae'.

#### The goals of the project are:
- To provide easy access to setting information for players
- To be thoroughly cross-linked (any mention of a person, place or fact will be automatically highlighted)
- Any highlights can be delved into via tooltips
- Tooltips themselves will contain highlights, with tooltips appearing on top of tooltips.
- To be thoroughly cross-navigable (any highlighted term that relates to a full page will have a link to that page in its tooltip)
- And for one day soon enable the addition of player-written articles via an entry form, by posting to the Wiki as their characters
