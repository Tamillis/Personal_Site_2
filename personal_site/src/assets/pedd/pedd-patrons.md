#### Archfey

(TODO: Shove these Patrons into Powers)

**Fey Presence** - You have the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey once per Short Rest. As an Action, you can cause each character in a 15ft cube centred on you to make a Willpower saving throw against your Magic Save. The characters that fail their saving throws suffer the Charmed or Frightened conditions (your choice) until the end of the next Round.

**Magic Statistic** - the current [Verdance](/pedd/magic#-verdance-table) + your Bonus. Additionally if you reside, spending more time than not, in a single region for a lunar month of 28 days, the Verdance of that region increases by a stage (unless it is already Abundant). After this, if you leave, it reverts to the previous stage over the course of another lunar month of 28 days.

**Spell List** - If you take Pact Magic, you use the Primal Sphere spell list in addition to your Emblematic Spells. You remove your Anathema Spells from the Primal List.
