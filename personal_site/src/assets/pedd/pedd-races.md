Thinking of compacting races a bit as well to reflect the setting and to mark another way this system is separate from D&D.

Base races: can be played as is.

Templates: can be 'attached' to certain base race/s and add/takeaway to that Race.

Bloodline: template on Humans & Halflings. One +1 Any to a fixed Stat and gives access to 3 racial powers and to one of a selection of "tags", one for each blood line (will also smoothly allow me to add in Ásar, Tieflings etc.).

The Curse of Gruumsh: template on Human, Any +2 and Any +1 must be Liminal Stats (strength or dexterity), and the Any -1 must be Mental (Intelligence or Charisma). Red Rage Racial power.

We're totally not Tolkeinesque, so renaming the obvious fantasy races:
- Elf -> Gnascoria (latin for originator)
- Gnome -> Cognoverimus-or ("we will get to know-er") -> Gnoverimo(s)
