Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands. \n\n**Telepathic Connection**. While your familiar is within 100ft of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can shut off your senses and see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. \n\n**Deliver Spells**. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch instead. Your familiar must be within 100ft of you, and it must take a Action to deliver the touch when you cast the spell. \n\n**Combat**. The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar uses the stats and actions of its stat block as normal. \n\n**Destruction and Desummoning**. When the familiar drops to 0 Health, it disappears back to its home plane. When you cast this spell again, you can choose to summon the same spirit or a different one. As an Action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to its home plane. If you do so, you can cast this spell again without a Material cost to summon that same spirit. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever, as if it had reached 0 Health. When the familiar is destroyed or desummoned, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.\n\n**Changing Form**. You can't have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast the spell again while your familiar is present and within 100ft, you do not spend the material cost and you can change which Beast form it has."
