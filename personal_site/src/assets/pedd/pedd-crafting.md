# PEDD Crafting

## Synopsis

I just had some thoughts basically along the rather un-inventive line of, what if D&D had MMO style crafting, but obviously adapted for the medium. People fucking love crafting systems. Look at all the x-craft games. The challenge of adapting said systems to a tabletop roleplaying game intrigued me.

## Skills and Levels

OK so most crafting systems have levels of a profession, where each level gives access to the ability to craft specific items with specific ingredients. The crafting system, then, essentially becomes a set of related trees (with many levels / professions providing ingredients for later levels and other professions). So a map of craftable items, and the ingredients to craft them, and then levels/tiers for them to be crafted at should be made.

This does imply a sort of two-tier approach for professions: item producing professions and raw material producing professions, which reflects such systems in many games. You have your gathering professions and crafting professions.

That said, the "skill" of gathering professions is more A: the ability to successfully harvest the resource, and B: everything else which the exploration pillar of regular play entails (prospecting, hauling etc.).

## Blacksmithing
As the ur system, and first tree to use as a basis for system creation. Start with armour and weapons. The core of much of D&D's items anyway.

## Alchemy
Because just reskinning arcane magic as alchemy sucks. Because the alchemist subclass of artificer is underwhelming in its approach to alchemy. Because, like PF2, there should just be a list of alchemical items that can be crafted, with Power/s to enhance that. Adapting PF2:

### Alchemy Power
#### Formula Book
An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You have a book of formulas. This formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice. You can copy formula you find into your formula book, spending 50gp per level on the necessary experimentation and resources. If you take this power again, you invent 2 new formula of your choice, and add them directly to your book.

#### Field Alchemy
You've learned how to quickly and reliably produce alchemical products even while out in the field. At the end of a Long Rest, you spend some time to create unstable alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you use an alchemist's toolkit, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. Each item must be in your formula book, and have the consumable trait. These items remain potent for 24 hours or until your next Long Rest, whichever comes first, unless the item has an even shorter shelf life, in which case that is kept.

You can Craft a number of alchemical items whose level totals up to 4 + your Intelligence. If you take this Power again, add 4 to this value.

In addition to your formulas, you can always prepare the alchemical item 'Acid Vial'.

 - **Acid Vial**. This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can be used offensively in a pinch. The glass vial, when thrown like a bomb, deals 1d6 acid damage and 1 Scatter acid damage to a target within 20ft, or 60ft at Disadvantage.

## Runes
The WORD is a big part of the lore, which are my re-interpretation of the prevelance (but otherwise weirdly unremarked) of runes in D&D. So a gathering / crafting skill based around learning Power Words and enscribing them with runes and runesmithing, right??

## Enchanting
The "Infusions" resource for Artificers ends up being a hyper-specific set of Powers for that one niche. Instead they'd fit much better as the start of an "Enchanting" crafting tree.
