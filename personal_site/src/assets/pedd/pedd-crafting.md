# PEDD Crafting

## Synopsis

I just had some thoughts basically along the rather un-inventive line of, what if D&D had MMO style crafting, but obviously adapted for the medium. People fucking love crafting systems. Look at all the x-craft games. The challenge of adapting said systems to a tabletop roleplaying game intrigued me.

## Skills and Levels

OK so most crafting systems have levels of a profession, where each level gives access to the ability to craft specific items with specific ingredients. The crafting system, then, essentially becomes a set of related trees (with many levels / professions providing ingredients for later levels and other professions). So a map of craftable items, and the ingredients to craft them, and then levels/tiers for them to be crafted at should be made.

This does imply a sort of two-tier approach for professions: item producing professions (one for each category? weapon, armour, equipment, alchemy, magic items, runes) and raw material producing professions, which reflects such systems in many games. You have your gathering professions and crafting professions.

## Gathering
That said, the "skill" of gathering professions is more A: the ability to successfully harvest the resource (which most of the time should be automatic, and when interesting, a single skill check), and B: everything else which the exploration pillar of regular play entails (prospecting, hauling etc.), and not necessarily a system to be simulated and gamified (most likely poorly, given the scope of such an activity).

## Blacksmithing
As the ur system, and first tree to use as a basis for system creation. Start with armour and weapons. The core of much of D&D's items anyway. I don't really see a reason to separate them into Weapon and Armour Smithing beyond maybe some Powers-based bonuses.

## Alchemy
I have adopted the PF2 system: a list of alchemical items that can be crafted, with Power/s (namely Field Alchemy) to enhance that.

It is worth having a level system for alchemical items, to allow for different base power levels and certain items with scaling effects: known as alchemical "grades". Low-grade (TBC), house-grade, industrial-grade, military-grade, super-grade (TBC).

Note: I have yet to peruse the spellbook and convert what I think ought to be converted from spells into potions.

## Runes
The WORD is a big part of the lore, which are my re-interpretation of the prevelance (but otherwise weirdly unremarked) of runes in D&D. So a gathering / crafting skill based around learning Power Words and enscribing them with runes and runesmithing, right??

This is a system I naturally don't want to define, if only provide some examples of. DM's and players should look to define runes, as much as words are defined through use and function in the real world. So a system of magic creation, essentially.

## Enchanting
The "Infusions" resource for Artificers ends up being a hyper-specific set of Powers for that one niche. Instead they'd fit much better as the start of an "Enchanting" crafting tree.
