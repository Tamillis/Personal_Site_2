# PEDD Crafting

## Synopsis

I just had some thoughts basically along the rather un-inventive line of, what if D&D had MMO style crafting, but obviously adapted for the medium. People fucking love crafting systems. Look at all the x-craft games. The challenge of adapting said systems to a tabletop roleplaying game intrigued me.

## Skills and Levels

OK so most crafting systems have levels of a profession, where each level gives access to the ability to craft specific items with specific ingredients. The crafting system, then, essentially becomes a set of related trees (with many levels / professions providing ingredients for later levels and other professions). So a map of craftable items, and the ingredients to craft them, and then levels/tiers for them to be crafted at should be made.

This does imply a sort of two-tier approach for professions: item producing professions and raw material producing professions, which reflects such systems in many games. You have your gathering professions and crafting professions.

That said, the "skill" of gathering professions is more A: the ability to successfully harvest the resource, and B: everything else which the exploration pillar of regular play entails (prospecting, hauling etc.).

## Blacksmithing
As the ur system, and first tree to use as a basis for system creation. Start with armour and weapons. The core of much of D&D's items anyway.

## Alchemy
Because just reskinning arcane magic as alchemy sucks. Because the alchemist subclass of artificer is underwhelming in its approach to alchemy. Because, like PF2, there should just be a list of alchemical items that can be crafted, with Power/s to enhance that.

Is it worth having a level system for alchemical items, to allow for different base power levels and certain items with scaling effects: a "grade" system.

### Alchemical Items
- Acid Vial
- flash bang - from armories of 2nd emp
- grenade - from armories of 2nd emp
- mine - disguised grenade
- grease pot
- glue bomb
- Burning something
- ice burst
- water deluge
- shock-stun stones
- sleep powder
- paralyze dart
- poison gas
- choking gas
- mana surge - temporary counter-magic effect up to spell level equal to grade
- tripwire alarm
- weapon coatings
- armour resistance coatings, armour buffs
- stat buffs / stat maluses
- liquid luck
- soul saver - passes death save

## Runes
The WORD is a big part of the lore, which are my re-interpretation of the prevelance (but otherwise weirdly unremarked) of runes in D&D. So a gathering / crafting skill based around learning Power Words and enscribing them with runes and runesmithing, right??

## Enchanting
The "Infusions" resource for Artificers ends up being a hyper-specific set of Powers for that one niche. Instead they'd fit much better as the start of an "Enchanting" crafting tree.
