## Skills & Proficiency
What steadily became a more and more significant subsection of PEDD was the skills system. It began as the flattening of the odd distinction between the small yet related categories of "Skills, Tools, Languages, Weapon and Armor Proficiencies", where for simplificty and new player's sake they were all lumped together.

Since then there has also been a pass over skills, with some skills changed, added or removed, and tools, weapons and armour have in particular been overhauled. For example, due to being promoted to a Stat, Perception is no longer a Skill. Occultism, as the missing knowledge skill representing that sphere of magic and occultish lore, has been added, as have certain 'tool' skills.

Weapons have also been redefined from "Simple" and "Martial" weapons, where you no longer earn Proficiency per individual weapon or for the sweeping groups of "Simple" and "Martial", but instead into weapon classes: each its own skill. For item categorisation and shorthand, the idea of "simple" and "martial" weapons remains, but doesn't affect gameplay further than what skills can be taken during "Upbringing".

**Body**, representing proficiency with unarmed combat, has been introduced as a Weapon Skill, to remove Unarmed Combat from its odd state of limbo.

All of these are now "Skills" in which you have "Proficiency", or not, meaning you gain your Bonus to the skill check roll.

### Proficiency, Bonus and Expertise
The odd inconsistencies of Proficiency, double proficiency and Expertise have also been cleaned up and unified.

**Proficiency** - having Proficiency allows you to apply your **Bonus** to a skill check. Every Proficiency is a Bonus, but not all Bonuses are from Proficiencies, to be clear.

**Bonus** - due to various sources, Powers, Skill Proficiencies etc, GM fiat, you may be able to add a Bonus to a roll. Except in exceptional circumstances the GM and the table feel are valid, you don't gain more than 1 Bonus to a roll at a time. The common exception to this are certain Powers which state "a +X bonus in addition to any proficiency". Initially, "Bonus" is a +2 increase.

A special powerful Power, “Aptitude”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3, then +4 and finally +5.

**Expertise** - Certain Powers can grant Expertise to certain Skills or circumstances which specifically means the Bonus is doubled. Every area of the game that grants Expertise only does so when that area already has a Proficiency Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a regular Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 with Expertise).

### Skill Statistics
In PEDD no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, the alternate 5e rule many of us run with anyway, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. Due to the shake-up in stats, some of the suggestions are not what they were in 5e, and some of the defaults are changed to match my own sensibility. Of course, you can always use other stats than the defaults: Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use a Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: **Strength** for Melee, **Accuracy** for Ranged. If the weapon has the property "Finesse" you can instead use **Dexterity** for the attacks (melee or ranged).

### Knowledge and Martial Skills
There are two kinds of specialist skills:
- **Knowledge Skills** - skills which most of the time you *cannot* attempt the actions that would be governed by this skill unless Proficient. You either know something, or you do not. For example the new skill 'Culture', which represents learning in the cultural mores and sociology both generally and for specific areas.
- **Martial Skills** - skills with weapons, armour and shields. Unlike other skills, some Martial Skills are marked with an *, meaning they require other Martial Skills before they can be taken. If a Background or Power provide Proficiency in such a skill before you have the requirement, you "Downgrade" it to the required Skill instead.
  - Heavy Armour requires Medium Armour which requires Light Armour.
  - Battle-Axes and Mauls require Clubs & Axes.
  - Heavy Blades requires Blades which requires Knives.
  - Pole-Arms requires Spears

### Tools
This section used to be called "Getting Rid of Tools, Game Sets, Instruments and Kits". They were awkward, and often too fine-grained, and more often than not an ignored part of 5e. They've received the weapons treatment: getting parsed into broader categories that are then just skills in which to take proficiency.

Tools the item still exist and can be used just like any other item in the game, opening up role-playing opportunities that can then be rolled on as required.

| **Enigneering** | For most Artisan's tools used in crafting.
| **Strategy** | For thinking game sets like Chess
| **Naviagation** | Navigators tools |
| **Disguise** | Disguise kit, forgery kit when forging stamps and such apparel |
