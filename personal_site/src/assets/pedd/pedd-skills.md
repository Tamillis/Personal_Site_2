### The Check
When your character attempts a challenge: something that has a clear chance of failure with dramatically signifcant consequences, whether that means in terms of success or failure, or time taken, or resources expended, it may call for a "Skill Check", more simply known as a **Check**.

All Checks in Trinitas follow the formula:

> d20 + Stat + Bonus vs DC

**DC** - an older gaming term meaning "Difficulty Class", that basically means "Target Number". Beat or meet this number to "succeed". The GM is responsible for determining the DC, and may keep the value hidden, simply stating the result. Some areas of the game, such as saves, provide DC's instead of GM fiat.

**Stat** - a Statistic of your character. See below.

Two major aspects affect the above formula: Advantage and Bonuses.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
- **Advantage** - If, due to circumstance, a GM determines a character has an advantage vs if they were to attempt the same task "normally", the player can roll 2 d20's and keep the higher number.
- **Disadvantage** - the same as for Advantage, put in the opposite direction. The player rolls 2 d20 and takes the lower roll.

### Bonus
**Bonus** - due to various sources: Powers, Skill Proficiencies, GM fiat etc., you add a value to your roll. This starts at +2. Except in exceptional circumstances the GM and the table feel are valid, you don't gain more than 1 Bonus to a roll at a time.

A special powerful Power, “Aptitude”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3, then to +4 and finally to +5.

## Statistics

All characters have 9* **Statistics**, a.k.a. "Stats", 6 active Stats used for Checks and Actions, and 3 passive Stats known also as "Resistances" used for Saves to mitigate harms. 

Each is a single value ranging from -3 to +5. (These values are higher and lower for monsters and "Super humans", with in-system values running from -5 to +10).

The six **Statistics** are:
- **Accuracy** - used in ranged attacks, and feats of precision
- **Perception** - used to sense the world, spot hidden things, and read others
- **Strength** - used in melee attacks, and feats of brawn
- **Dexterity** - used in many skills, for feats of deftness
- **Intelligence** - used to learn knowledge, understand puzzles and in cunning and manipulation, for feats of alacrity
- **Charisma** - used to move others through force of personality, empathy and displays of emotion, genuine or otherwise

These are used to build the 3 **Resistances**:
- **Reflexes** - the ability to avoid harms. Calculated from the average of **Accuracy** and **Perception**.
- **Fortitude** - the ability of the body to throw off and work-through ills. Calculated from the average of **Strength** and **Dexterity**.
- **Willpower** - the ability of the mind to resist. Calculated from the average of **Intelligence** and **Charisma**.

> Round up if not a whole number (i.e. for 2 Accuracy and -1 Perception, that character has 1 Reflexes).

#### The Trinitates
The idea behind the particular Stats is the following schema of worldy-interaction known as The Trinitates:

| - | Direct | Indirect | Reactive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ***External*** | Accuracy | Perception | Reflexes |
| ***Liminal*** | Strength | Dexterity | Fortitude |
| ***Internal*** | Charisma | Intelligence | Willpower |

*The Trinitas of Action*:
- Direct affect, when a character affects the world and its actors directly.
- Indirect application, where interaction is more subtle and an affect is coaxed out.
- Reactive response, where a character is moved by the world.

*The Trinitas of Origin*:
- External Stats affect the world at a distance from a character
- Limenal means at point of contact.
- Internal of course means interaction through the lense of the character's inner world: their mentality.

#### Stat Values
Stat Value | Name | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
-3 | Severely Handicapped | even menial tasks are difficult
-2 | Handicapped | most basic tasks are difficult
-1 | Below Average | you fail to overcome most challenges
0 | Average | unremarkable, equivalent to an unskilled labourer
1 | Capable | you're more capable than the unskilled
2 | Professional | you're trusted to succeed
3 | Exceptional | you're renowned within the region
4 | World-class | few in the nation can best you
5 | Legendary | your capability is on the level of myth

Stats are determined by your Race, Background and Role, which produces a meaningful spread of Stats. There is no system for rolling stats. 

#### World-Class Beginnings
During character creation no Statistic can be increased beyond +4, unless explicitly stated. If a Race, Background or Role would raise a Stat above 4, instead you may raise a different Stat (again, not above 4).

#### Having Faith*
If you get involved in matters of the divine, the 10<sup>th</sup> Stat that is above the trinitates, your Faith, becomes important. All characters are welcome to have and track their Faith, but only those with the Power `Divine Spellcasting` or other Faith-using Power need to track it for in-game reasons. 

(Note, do not calculate Faith like other Statistics during character creation, instead Faith is a value that starts at 2 that is affected by your character's actions during play):

- **Faith** - the attunment of your soul to the divine path of your deity / path / philosophy.

#### Passive Stats
Sometimes enemy attacks and other effects are made against your "Resistance DC", "Magic Stat" or other passive value. This is:

> 8 + the Stat + your Bonus (if proficient in a save or skill)

### Secondary Statistics
Certain Secondary Statistics are also important to know.

- **Size** - what category of size you are, determined by Race. Determines the physical space you take up on a combat grid, your Base Defence and Base Health.

| Size | Diameter | Base Defence | Base Health |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | 1ft | 14 | 2 |
| Small | 2.5ft | 10 | 4 |
| Medium | 5ft | 8 | 6 |
| Large | 10ft | 6 | 12 |
| Huge | 20ft | 2 | 25 |

- **Speed** - the ground you can cover in a Move, determined by your Race and some Powers. Most start at 30ft.
- **Health** - how much damage you can take before entering the Dying state. Health is explicitly a combination of physical and emotional wear and tear, and the ability to roll with and carry on from blows. To determine your starting total Health:
> **Health** = **Base Health** + **Fortitude** + **Willpower**

- **Defence** - how difficult you are to harm. 
  - **Base Defence** - determined by Size (see above). Smaller characters are harder to hit.
  - **Armour Bonus** - determined by the sum Defence of worn equipment.
  - **Stat Bonus** - by default, your **Reflexes**. This is limited by Stiff Armour and ignored by Heavy Armour. Some Powers may also affect this value or change the stat/s.
> **Defence** = **Base Defence** + **Armour Bonus** + **Stat Bonus**

- **Focus** - your **Willpower** value to a minimum of 1. Used in certain Tactical Actions.

For a deeper explanation of *Health*, *Defence* and *Focus*, see [Combat](/trinitas/combat).

These 'Statistics' are not used in the game explicitely, but are a fun little aside for calculating ancilliary values for your character. Feel free to skip this step if you're not interested, or completely ignore its results.

- **Appearance** - the comeliness of your visage, **Strength** + **Charisma**
- **Agility** - the speed and adroitness with which you move, **Dexterity** + **Accuracy**
- **Foresight** - your ability to predict how things will come out moment-to-moment, **Perception** + **Intelligence**

A few Powers may use these Stats, but only explicitely as the combination of normal Stats that define them, such as with `Foresighted Defence` which is built upon Perception and Intelligence.

## Skills
Whenever a character attempts an action, the GM will ask if your character has a certain "skill" that they think governs the action being undertaken. These are areas of knowledge and experience a character has, through training, education or practical experience, that makes them more likely to succeed. In gameplay terms, they gain their "Bonus" to the skill check.

Players are free to ask whether a different Skill can be applied, which may change the approach entirely, and this is all a good part of cooperative roleplay.

### Proficiency and Expertise
Having a skill is often referred to as having **Proficiency**. If you have "proficiency in Nature", this simply means you have the skill Nature, meaning if you undertake an action using Nature, you gain your Bonus to the skill check.

**Expertise** - Certain Powers can grant Expertise to certain Skills or circumstances which specifically means your Bonus is doubled for those rolls. Every area of the game that grants Expertise only does so when that area already has a Proficiency Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a regular Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 with Expertise).

### Default Skill Statistics
In Trinitas no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. Of course, you can always use other stats than the defaults: Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use a Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: **Strength** for Melee, **Accuracy** for Ranged. If the weapon has the property "Finesse" you can instead use **Dexterity** for the attacks (melee or ranged).
