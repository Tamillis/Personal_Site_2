## Skills & Proficiency
A part of PEDD is the flattening of the odd little distinct yet related categories of "Skills, Tools, Languages and Weapon & Armor Proficiencies", simplifying how we interact with the system for both consistency and new player's sake. Some skills have also been changed, added or removed, and weapon and armour skills in particular have been overhauled.

All of these are now "Skills" in which you have "Proficiency", or not, meaning you gain your Bonus to the skill check roll (which is how it always worked for all these disparate things, only now it is unified).

### Bonuses, Proficiency and Expertise
The odd inconsistencies of Proficiency, double proficiency and Expertise have also been cleaned up and unified.

**Proficiency a.k.a. Bonus** - having Proficiency allows you to apply your "Bonus" to a skill check, irrespective to any Bonus gained due to the details of a Power or a circumstantial bonus the GM decides to bestow. This replaces 5e 'Proficiency bonus'. Every Proficiency is a Bonus, but not all Bonuses are from Proficiencies, to be clear. Except in exceptional circumstances the GM and the table feel are valid, you don't gain more than 1 Bonus to a roll at a time.

A special Power, “Aptitude”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3, then +4 and finally +5.

**Expertise** - Abilities with Bonus can gain Expertise to be grant effectively a double Bonus. Every area of the game that grants Expertise should only do so when that area already has a Proficiency Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 with Expertise).

Weapons have also been regrouped into "Martial Skills", with redefined "Simple" and "Martial" weapons, where you no longer earn Proficiency per individual weapon or for the sweeping groups of "Simple" and "Martial", but instead in each "Weapon Skill". The old system was too fine-grained as well as bizarrely too broad as most gained weapon proficiencies through the massive sets "Simple" and "Martial" via their classes, and then a few odd weapons here and there.

Some skills have changed, been removed or new ones added. For example, due to being promoted to a Stat, Perception is no longer a Skill. Occultism, as the missing knowledge skill representing that sphere of magic and occultish lore, has been added.

**Body**, representing proficiency with unarmed combat, has been introduced as a Simple Weapon Skill, to remove Unarmed Combat from its odd state of limbo. 

### Skill Statistics
In PEDD no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, the alternate 5e rule many of us run with anyway, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. Due to the shake-up in stats, some of the suggestions are not what they were in 5e. However if played well, you can Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use the Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: **Strength** for Melee, **Accuracy** for Ranged. If the weapon has the property "Finesse" you can instead use **Dexterity** for the attacks.

### Trained, Knowledge and Martial Skills
**Trained** - Most of the time anyone can attempt the actions that would be governed by a Skill even if they're not Proficient, with the DM occasionally asking for "Trained" characters only to make a roll, meaning only those with Proficiency in the Skill.

There are two kinds of specialist skills:
- **Knowledge Skills** - skills which most of the time you *cannot* attempt the actions that would be governed by this skill unless Proficient. You either know something, or you do not.
- **Martial Skills** - skills with weapons, armour and shields. Unlike other skills, some Martial Skills are marked with an *, meaning they require other Martial Skills before they can be taken. If a Background or Power provide Proficiency in such a skill before you have the requirement, you "Downgrade" it to the required Skill instead.
  - Heavy Armour requires Medium Armour which requires Light Armour. 
  - Battle-Axes and Mauls require Clubs & Axes.
  - Heavy Blades requires Blades which requires Knives.
  - Pole-Arms requires Spears
