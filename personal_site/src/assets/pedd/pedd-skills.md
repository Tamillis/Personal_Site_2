When your character attempts a challenge: something that has a clear chance of failure with dramatically signifcant consequences, whether that means in terms of success or failure, or time taken, or resources expended, it may call for a "Skill Check", more simply known as a "Check".

All Checks in Trinitas follow the formula:

> d20 + Stat vs DC

**DC** - an older gaming term meaning "Difficulty Class", that basically means "Target Number". Beat or meet this number to "succeed". The GM is responsible for determining the DC, and may keep the value hidden, simply stating the result. Some areas of the game, such as saves, provide DC's instead of GM fiat.

Two major aspects affect the above formula: Advantage and Bonuses.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
- **Advantage** - If, due to circumstance, a GM determines a character has an advantage vs if they were to attempt the same task "normally", the player can roll 2 d20's and keep the higher number.
- **Disadvantage** - the same as for Advantage, put in the opposite direction. The player rolls 2 d20 and takes the lower roll.

### Bonus
**Bonus** - due to various sources: Powers, Skill Proficiencies, GM fiat etc., you add a value to your roll. This starts at +2. Except in exceptional circumstances the GM and the table feel are valid, you don't gain more than 1 Bonus to a roll at a time.

A special powerful Power, “Aptitude”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3, then to +4 and finally to +5.

### Skills
Whenever a character attempts an action, the GM will ask if your character has a certain "skill" that they think governs the action being undertaken. These are areas of knowledge and experience a character has, through training, education or practical experience, that makes them more likely to succeed. In gameplay terms, they gain their "Bonus" to the skill check.

Players are free to ask whether a different Skill can be applied, which may change the approach entirely, and this is all a good part of cooperative roleplay.

### Proficiency and Expertise
Having a skill is often referred to as having **Proficiency**. If you have "proficiency in Nature", this simply means you have the skill Nature, meaning if you undertake an action using Nature, you gain your Bonus to the skill check.

**Expertise** - Certain Powers can grant Expertise to certain Skills or circumstances which specifically means your Bonus is doubled for those rolls. Every area of the game that grants Expertise only does so when that area already has a Proficiency Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a regular Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 with Expertise).

### Default Skill Statistics
In Trinitas no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. Of course, you can always use other stats than the defaults: Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use a Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: **Strength** for Melee, **Accuracy** for Ranged. If the weapon has the property "Finesse" you can instead use **Dexterity** for the attacks (melee or ranged).
