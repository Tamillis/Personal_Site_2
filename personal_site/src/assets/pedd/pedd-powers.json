You can copy formula you find into your formula book, spending 50gp per grade on the necessary experimentation and resources. If you take this power again, you invent 2 new formula of your choice including those of a grade above what you already have, and add them directly to your book.\n\n **Field Alchemy** - You've learned how to quickly and reliably produce alchemical products even while out in the field. At the end of a Long Rest, you spend some time to create unstable alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day, and you ignore material requirements. Each item must be in your formula book. These items remain potent for 24 hours or until your next Long Rest, whichever comes first, unless the item has an even shorter shelf life, in which case that is kept.\n\nYou can Craft a number of alchemical items whose grade totals up to 4 + your Intelligence. If you take this Power again, add 4 to this value.\n\n**Acid Vial** - In addition to your formulas and Field Alchemy, you can prepare and throw the alchemical item 'Acid Vial' as an Attack Action. This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can be used offensively in a pinch. The glass vial, when thrown like a bomb, deals 1d6 acid damage to a target within 20ft, or 60ft at Disadvantage, and 1 Scatter acid damage to any character within 5ft of the target if the attack roll would hit them.",

You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.\n - The object continuously emits your choice of an odour or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like).

This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.\n\nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely.

You regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n- You can transform into any Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 1\/2 (this system is due to be replaced with a WIP) or lower that doesn't have a flying, burrowing or swimming speed.\n- You can stay in a wild shape for 1 hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this Power. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Health, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your Accuracy, Perception, Strength, and Dexterity statistics, and therefore Reflexes and Fortitude, are replaced by those of the Beast. You retain your Intelligence, Charisma and Willpower statistics.\n- You retain all of your proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the Beast. Your Bonus is unchanged.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast's full Health. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the Health value you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Health, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in a form that has only 1 Health left, you revert and take 9 damage.\n- Your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands (etc.) is limited to the capabilities of your form, meaning you cannot cast any spells with Verbal or Somatic components. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, although it may prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast if they would require a human mouth, hands, etc.\n- You retain the benefit of any Powers and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, as your senses are replaced, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has them.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.",
