        "desc": "**Cantrips** - You know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcane Sphere.\n\n**Spellbook** - You have a spellbook containing six 1st-Magnitude arcane spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the spells you know, except your Innate spells, which are fixed in your mind. You can add to your spellbook through two methods: spell invention or by copying spells you encounter in your adventures. Spell invention is a Downtime Activity, where you 'invent' a spell of your choice from the Arcane Sphere spell list.\n\n**Transcription** - copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the intricacies of the spell into a form your mind can replicate in magic. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds and/or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each Magnitude of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\nAny spell scrolls, spell books or willing teachers you encounter in your adventures can let you copy spells into your spellbook.\n\n**Spell Invention** - enclosed in study, wizards perform experiments, decipher and combine criptic hints from fragmented scrolls and coax into existance entirely new spells. For each Magnitude of the Spell to be invented, the process takes 1 down time and 25gp. It can be any spell from the Arcane Sphere.\n\nYou can only invent and copy spells that you have the mana Magnitude for.\n\n**Replacing the Book** - You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own studies and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n**The Book's Appearance** - Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n\n**Preparing and Casting Spells** - You use your Reserve of Mana to cast spells, gained through the Mana Power. In addition to any Innate spells you know, you prepare a list of arcane spells that are available for you to cast each day. To do so, choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence + your Bonus. The spells must be of a Magnitude that you have the ability to Cast. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of arcane spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell Magnitude for each spell on your list.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability** - Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence when setting the saving throw DC for an arcane spell you Cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** - 8 + your Bonus + your Intelligence\n\n**Spell attack modifier** - your Bonus + your Intelligence\n\n**Ritual Casting** - You can cast an arcane spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus** - You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells."

At the end of a Long Rest, you spend some time to create unstable alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you use an alchemist's toolkit, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. Each item must be in your formula book, and have the consumable trait. These items remain potent for 24 hours or until your next Long Rest, whichever comes first, unless the item has an even shorter shelf life, in which case that is kept.\n\nYou can Craft a number of alchemical items whose level totals up to 4 + your Intelligence. If you take this Power again, add 4 to this value.\n\n**Acid Vial** - In addition to your formulas, you can always prepare the alchemical item 'Acid Vial'. This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can be used offensively in a pinch.

You are resistant to Slashing damage, and your Fortitude is increased by 1.\n- **Headful of Mismatched Eyes** - your passive perception is increased by 5, you gain proficiency in Observation, and your Perception score is increased by 1.\n- **Hypnotic Bioluminescence** - you know the Friends cantrip, using your Charisma to cast the spell, you gain proficiency in Persuasion, and your Charisma score is increased by 1."

You roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of Magnitude I or higher for the first time in a Round. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected Meta Magic, if you're able, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.\n\n**Tides of Chaos** - You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain Advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You regain expended uses when you finish a Short Rest.\n- You can transform into any beast that has a Challenge Rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying, burrowing or swimming speed.\n- You can stay in a wild shape for 1 hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this Power. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Health, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your Strength, Dexterity, Accuracy and Perception statistics are replaced by those of the Creature. You retain your Intelligence and Charisma statistics, and also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the Creature. If the Creature has the same Proficiency Bonus as you, but the Bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the Creature's Bonus instead of yours. If the Creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast's full Health. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the Health value you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Health, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in a form that has only 1 Health left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 Health, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands or humanoid mouth is limited to the capabilities of your form. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any Powers and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, as your senses are replaced, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has them.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."
