You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this Power. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a Bonus Action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Health, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your Strength, Dexterity, Accuracy and Perception statistics are replaced by those of the Creature. You retain your Intelligence and Charisma statistics, and also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the Creature. If the Creature has the same Proficiency Bonus as you, but the Bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the Creature's Bonus instead of yours. If the Creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast's full Health. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the Health value you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 Health, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in a form that has only 1 Health left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 Health, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands or humanoid mouth is limited to the capabilities of your form. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any Powers and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, as your senses are replaced, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has them.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."
