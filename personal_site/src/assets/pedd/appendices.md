## Characters, Creatures and Monsters
Like any TTRPG, Trinitas is focused around characters which as a term in the system means any individual (or swarm/group, in the case of blobbed enemies), associated with a block of stats and Actions they can do. All Player Characters are Character, but also all monsters, beasts, villains etc. are characters too.

There is also a clear emphasis on 'monster types' as well, called **Creature Types** which are referenced in certain Powers. They're the following categories:

### Character Types
- **Aberrations** - so-called 'true outsiders', enigmatic and horrifying beings from beyond the outer planes and the boundary of Time and Space itself, sometimes referred to as the 'Far Planes'
- **Beasts** - natural creatures of the material plane, though humanoids and other sophonts are excluded from this category.
- **Celestials** - beings of the Good planes
- **Constructs** - beings of the plane of Logic 
  - **Machines** - other constructs built by the hands of mortals in the image of divine logic or otherwise, on the material plane. This means there are "Outsider Constructs" and "Material Machines". That only Constructs seem capable of sentience, no matter how clever the Machine, is a matter of some theology.
    - **Automatons** - so-called sentient machines with souls.
- **Dragons** - beings of ancient power and deep hunger, said to be all that's left of the three Creators
- **Demons** - beings of the plane of Passion
- **Elementals** - beings of the four ribbons of the elemntal braid, those old things from when the creators first wove the physical realms, or newer spirits of the lands, seas and skies.
- **Fell** - beings of the realm of Shadowfell, though sometimes erronously mixed with Fey or Undead.
- **Fey** - beings of the realm of the Fey Wild
- **Fiends** - beings of the Evil planes
- **Giants** - those who're descendants of the Titans, the first and greatest of the Creator's children.
- **Humanoids** - also known as Sophonts, those typically of two legs and two arms of the physical realms who're capable of intelligent thought. Further subdivided into the Races of the worlds (a very long list indeed; dragonborn, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblinoid, half-elf, halfling, human, tuskman, etc. ...). Scholars argue that this should in-fact be two categories: humans and little-people.
- **Jurors** - beings of the planes of Reason, though often erronously confused with Celestials
- **Monstrosities** - creatures and other things of the physical realms and beyond, or a mix thereof, that require some mana to live. Things that are not 'of nature'.
  - **Lycanthropes** - regular humanoids or beasts who become monstrosities under specific conditions, typically having been infected with a shape-changing disease or placed under a corrupting curse.
- **Oozes** - curious life forms barely worthy of the name, neither plant nor animal nor fungus.
- **Plants** - and although scholars protest, fungi belong to this group
- **Sprites** - beings of the plane of Chaos
- **Undead** - natural, humanoid and legendary husks that're turned to evil means by the black breath of Exanima.

Certain Character Types are grouped into "Creatures" for the purposes of identification with certain Spells and Powers.
- **Outsiders**: aberrations, celestials, constructs, demons, fiends, jurors and sprites
- **Unnatural Creatures**: elementals, fell, fey, machines, monstrosities and undead
- **Natural Creatures**: beasts, oozes and plants (funghi are 'plants')
- **Legendary Creatures**: dragons, giants
- **Humanoids**: All the playable races, humans, little-people, beast-folk and the "monsterous races" who, at the end of the day, depend simply on who you ask.

There are many other classifications and subcategories that the Character Types can be grouped with or described by in-world:
- **Material creatures**: beasts, constructs, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, machines, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Living creatures**: beasts, dragons, fell, fey, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Light creatures**: celestials, fey, jurors, and constructs
- **Dark creatures**: aberrations, demons, fiends, lycanthropes, monstrosities (debated), fell, undead.
- **Magical creatures**: aberrations, dragons, elementals, giants, fell, fey, monstrosities and (if one counts as made-of magic, rather than bearing-magic) undead

## Miscellaneous Rules

### Metric 'Conversions' and other Term Clarifications
Certain measures consistently crop up so for reference here's what they would roughly be in metric:

| Imperial | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| 30ft | 10 metres |
| 5ft | 2 metres |
| 10 gallons | 40 litres |
| 5lbs | 2kg |
| 10lbs |4.5kg / 5kg |

1 Round is 5 seconds, give or take some dramatic leeway.

Power / Spell use of the words "Character" and "Target". A character is any Character, including not just humanoids but all types of creature. 

A **target** includes objects or particular points in space, basically any valid target of the Power / Spell. I'm in the process of rewording things to clearly match this definition, so use common sense if what the power / spell currently says doesn't make sense.

### N/A Statistics
A stat value of N/A, which only happens for NPCs, means that it is meaningless for that character to have a value for that stat. This is relatively common for Intelligence and various non-sophont characters. Any skill check that is called for using that stat automatically fails, as does any save. It may be the case that the check or save is instead done with a different stat, or entirely nullified by the GM. Many mind affecting spells don't have any affect on unintelligent creatures, for example.

### Vision

The specific rules for Vision.

Your vision is "Normal" unless stated otherwise, but other kinds of vision exist, such as:

- **Darkvision** - 
- **Truesight** - Characters with Truesight can see invisible characters and objects, automatically succeed to see through illusions, and see into the ethereal plane where it intersects and other planar boundaries.
- **Devil's Sight** - You gain the effects of “Darkvision”. Additionally, you can see in both magical and nonmagical darkness, as if it were dim light to a distance of 120ft.

Vision varies based on Light Conditions, which are:

- **Bright Light** - Virtually all light sources produce bright light, and even "gloomy" daytime environments are still considered bright.
- **Dim Light** - The soft light of twilight and dawn, or the boundary between bright light and darkness. Also called "shadows" or "lightly obscured."
- **Darkness** - Heavily obscured. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a room with no windows, or in an area of magical darkness
- **Blinded** - A blinded character can’t see and automatically fails any check that requires sight. If their Attacks rely on this sense, they are made at Disadvantage.

This looks like:

| - | Normal Vision | Darkvision | Truesight | Devil's Sight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bright Light** | See normally | See normally | See normally | See normally |
| **Dim Light** | Disadvantage on PER checks; -5 to passive perception | See normally | See normally | See normally |
| **Darkness** | Blinded | Disadvantage on PER checks; -5 to passive perception | See normally | See normally (120ft) |
| **Magical Darkness** | Blinded | Varies by Spell | See normally | See normally (120ft) |

### Familiar

 A character, creature or object you are "Familiar" with means on you have personally met in close physical proximity. Alternatively it can be a character, creature or object you have sufficiently studied through descriptions, histories, pictures etc.
