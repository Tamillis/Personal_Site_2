## Characters, Creatures and Monsters
Instances of 'creature' are updated to 'character' as generally the game is character focused and the clearer language helps. All monsters, beasts etc. do count as characters in this instance. However there is also a greater, clearer, emphasis on so-called 'monster types' as well, and are referenced in certain Powers. They're the (slightly expanded and rejigged) following categories known as Character Types:

### Character Types
- **Aberrations** - so-called 'true outsiders', enigmatic and horrifying beings from beyond the outer planes and the boundary of Time and Space itself, sometimes referred to as the 'Far Planes'
- **Beasts** - natural creatures of the material plane, though humanoids and other sophonts are excluded from this category.
- **Celestials** - beings of the Good planes
- **Constructs** - beings of the plane of Logic 
  - **Machines** - other constructs built by the hands of mortals in the image of divine logic or otherwise, on the material plane. This means there are "Outsider Constructs" and "Material Machines". That only Constructs seem capable of sentience, no matter how clever the Machine, is a matter of some theology.
- **Dragons** - beings of ancient power and deep hunger, said to be all that's left of the three Creators
- **Demons** - beings of the plane of Passion
- **Elementals** - beings of the four ribbons of the elemntal braid, those old things from when the creators first wove the physical realms, or newer spirits of the lands, seas and skies.
- **Fell** - beings of the realm of Shadowfell, though sometimes erronously mixed with Fey or Undead.
- **Fey** - beings of the realm of the Fey Wild
- **Fiends** - beings of the Evil planes
- **Giants** - those who're descendants of the Titans, the first and greatest of the Creator's children.
- **Humanoids** - also known as Sophonts, those typically of two legs and two arms of the physical realms who're capable of intelligent thought. Further subdivided into the Races of the worlds (a very long list indeed; dragonborn, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblinoid, half-elf, halfling, human, tuskman, etc. ...). Scholars argue that this should in-fact be two categories: humans and little-people.
- **Jurors** - beings of the planes of Reason, though often erronously confused with Celestials
- **Monstrosities** - creatures and other things of the physical realms and beyond, or a mix thereof, that require some mana to live. Things that are not 'of nature'.
  - **Lycanthropes** - regular humanoids or beasts who become monstrosities under specific conditions, typically having been infected with a shape-changing disease or placed under a corrupting curse.
- **Oozes** - curious life forms barely worthy of the name, neither plant nor animal nor fungus.
- **Plants** - and although scholars protest, fungi belong to this group
- **Sprites** - beings of the plane of Chaos
- **Undead** - natural, humanoid and legendary husks that're turned to evil means by the black breath of Exanima.

Certain Character Types are grouped into "Creatures" for the purposes of identification with certain Spells and Powers.
- **Outsiders**: aberrations, celestials, constructs, demons, fiends, jurors and sprites
- **Unnatural Creatures**: elementals, fell, fey, machines, monstrosities and undead
- **Natural Creatures**: beasts, oozes and plants (funghi are 'plants')
- **Legendary Creatures**: dragons, giants
- **Humanoids**: All the playable races, humans, little-people, beast-folk and the "monsterous races" who, at the end of the day, depend simply on who you ask.

There are many other classifications and subcategories that the Character Types can be grouped with or described by in-world:
- **Material creatures**: beasts, constructs, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, machines, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Living creatures**: beasts, dragons, fell, fey, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Light creatures**: celestials, fey, jurors, and constructs
- **Dark creatures**: aberrations, demons, fiends, lycanthropes, monstrosities (debated), fell, undead.
- **Magical creatures**: aberrations, dragons, elementals, giants, fell, fey, monstrosities and (if one counts as made-of magic, rather than bearing-magic) undead


## Miscellaneous Changes
Changes to D&D 5e that don't fit in one of the major categories above. As PEDD has grown, this section has shrunk as what was here, has now become their own sections.

### Metric 'Conversions' and other Term Clarifications
Certain measures consistently crop up so for reference here's what they would roughly be in metric:
30ft - 10 metres
5ft - 2 metres
10 gallons - 40 litres

Also, 1 Round is 6 seconds, give or take some dramatic leeway.

Power / Spell use of the words "Character" and "Target". A character is any humanoid or other type of creature. A target includes objects or particular points in space, basically anything. I'm in the process of rewording things to clearly match this definition, so use common sense if what the power / spell currently says doesn't make sense.

### N/A Statistics
I think I've written elsewhere but I can't find it now. A stat value of N/A, which only happens for NPCs, means that it is meaningless for that character to have a value for that stat. This is relatively common for Intelligence and various non-sophont characters. Any skill check that is called for using that stat automatically fails, as does any save. It may be the case that the check or save is instead done with a different stat, or entirely nullified by the GM. Many mind affecting spells don't have any affect on unintelligent creatures, for example.
