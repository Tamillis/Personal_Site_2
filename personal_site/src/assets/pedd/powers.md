Prerequisites - Intelligence +1
Description - : **Cantrips** - You know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcane Sphere.

**Spellbook** - You have a spellbook containing six 1st-Magnitude arcane spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the spells you know, except your Innate spells, which are fixed in your mind. You can add to your spellbook through two methods: spell invention or by copying spells you encounter in your adventures. Spell invention is a downtime activity, and you can only invent spells that you have the mana Magnitude for. Any spell scrolls, spell books or willing teachers you encounter in your adventures can let you copy those spells into your spellbook. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the intricacies of the spell into a form your mind can replicate in magic. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds and/or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each Magnitude of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

**Replacing the Book** - You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own studies and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

**The Book's Appearance** - Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

**Preparing and Casting Spells** - You also gain one rank in the Mana Reserve and Magnitude Power, which you use to cast your spells. In addition to any Innate spells you know, you prepare a list of arcane spells that are available for you to cast each day. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence + your Bonus. The spells must be of a Magnitude that you have the ability to Cast. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of arcane spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability** - Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence when setting the saving throw DC for an arcane spell you Cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** - 8 + your Bonus + your Intelligence

**Spell attack modifier** - your Bonus + your Intelligence

**Ritual Casting** - You can cast an arcane spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

**Spellcasting Focus** - You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. :
