## Powers
In a move I've wanted to do since I've ever started tweaking 5e, I introduce an abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replacing it with "Powers" (created from D&D 5e SRD Features, Feats, Spells and from whole-cloth). The intent is to allow for any combination of Powers to be allowed for all sorts of different and unique characters, and to replace levelling with a more story-driven powers "In-Training" progression system, where characters discover, train in and then unleash Powers.

A Power is, in the old parlance, a 'feature'; an ability of a character to do something extraordinary beyond the day-to-day ken of your normal person. Whether that be to do something but better, do something that was otherwise impossible or grant access to something in addition to usual routes. Powers - as the name implies - empower you to adventure!

Most Powers have Prerequisites that you must meet before taking them, with those with none being freely available to all. Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of higher prerequisites such as Stats or the presence of other Powers. Many such "punchy" Powers also have the prerequisites “After N Powers”, meaning n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken, or "Every N<sup>th</sup> Power" which means the Power can be taken multiple times, but only after N other Powers have been taken. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

Natural sub-categories of Powers are tagged for ease of perusal.

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers. Many Powers describe the differences that occur when the Power is taken more than once.

### Tags
Powers come with tags for ease of perusal and understanding. <a id="toggle-tags">Click here for explanation</a>:

<section id="tags-section" class="hidden"> 

- **Racial** - Powers that can only be gained from being a certain Race, representing in-born racial abilities that you couldn't gain no matter how much you train, and can only be taken during character creation. Some Powers a race can choose from as a Racial power are Background Powers, as conceivably any race if in a position (i.e. background) to study them could do so and could learn them, then they ought not be racial powers.
- **Background** - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background, the skills and abilities of your childhood and professional life before becoming an adventurer
- **Cantrip** - a Power that grants the ability to use a cantrip without needing Spellcasting
- **Combat** / **Exploration** / **Social** / **Universal** - used in the respective pillar of play or in all. Only Powers that belong to a Resource aren't labelled with one.
- Combat has the following sub tags (at least one), as its such a significant pillar of play in terms of game design: 
  - **Offensive** - damaging effects against a target or targets, direct or indirect through saves
  - **Defensive** - effects that increase Defence or in otherwise help protect the character
    - **Damage Reduction** - a further subcategory of defense where the Power grants Resistance (half damage to certain damage types) or Immunity (0 damage from certain damage types)
  - **Crowd-Control** - non-damaging effects that hinder the target
  - **Movement** - increases the movement capability of the character
  - **Healing** - restores health or temporary health to yourself or a target
  - **Temporary-Health** - provides an amount of Temporary Health that lasts until the next Long Rest, you gain more Temporary Health from another source (keeping whichever is greater), or you take damage enough to drain it
  - **Utility** - an ancilliary effect that is none of the above
- **Stat** - a Stat increasing Power
  - **Health** - a subcategory of Stat, where Health is increased
- **Sense** - a Power that enhances the senses of the character in some way
- **Skill** - a Power that grants a proficiency Bonus or Expertise, or some other effect towards a Skill
- **Spellcasting** - a Power that grants the knowledge of and ability to cast certain spells, or is one of the fully-fledged XYZ Spellcasting Powers and the Mana Power that fuels them.
- **Spell-like** - a Power that grants the abilties and effects of a spell, without the knowledge of that spell or indeed without necessarily using magic at all, as the Power could be inborn ability, chemical knowledge or any other number of means to produce a spell-like effect.
- **Roll-Effecting** - used to modify a dice roll, such as grant a Bonus, flat value, Advantage or Disadvantage
- **Healing** - inc self-healing, combat health recovery
- **Recovery** - recovery of health and resources outside combat.
- **Resource** - a Power that gives access to a pool of thematically related powers, each of which are tagged for convenience. Current resources are: fighting-styles, invocations, ki powers, meta-magics, miracles (through Divine Domain's Channel Divinity), patrons, and sorcerous-origins. These do not count towards your total number of powers, but each Power taken through the resource does.
- **Passive** - a flat bonus to an aspect of the game
- **Utility** - a.k.a. a ribbon ability, some other effect that enhances who you are as a character and otherwise not fitting into the above non-pillar categories

### Powers In Training
Powers are “in-training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power. Alternatively, play make indicate a certain Power a character should take next as a natural next progression.

The amount of time needed for a Power is thematic, and depends on the pace of the game being played, your table's position on the arcade-to-simulation scale, and of course the Power itself. Many PEDD Powers also refer to being able to learn other Powers at an "increased rate". By default you can think of this as halving the amount of time, though again it depends on the table and style of play at hand.

As a guide, though this is not in any way implemented yet, Powers will have a "training" header that gives two key bits of information: the intensitiy of the training required and the length. As a guide I envision 3 stages of intensity: a power that requires full time study (think like a 9-5), a power that requires part-time study (such as over the weekend), and powers that can be learnt in a hobby-like fashion, just an hour or so a day. Lengths are fairly self explanatory, at the described intensity, how long do they take? A day? A month? A year? The DM and table are encouraged to fluff this number as approriate to the Power, the character and the situation, and of course, for what is fun to play.

One aspect of the intention behind the training design is that a character can have multiple powers "in training" at once, based on the different levels of intensity. There's no reason a character couldn't be training 9-5 on their body to earn the Statistic Increase Power with the goal of improving their Strength, whilst also drilling the weekends to hone your soothing music to train 'Song of Rest', and during a quiet hour each day work on your language skill to pick up an 'Extra Language'.

### A Reflection on Powers
Obviously, what I'd decided to do was translate the features of 5e as-is as much as possible: for the twin reasons of simplicity and familiarity. However seeing as PEDD is drifting further and further from its point of origin, and now we have this pretty list of often rather fine grained powers with plenty of awkward prerequisites, odd benefits and often boxed in bizare categories, me thinks it is time to start making more serious changes.

Primarily, I'm inspired by another classless system I saw that also did away with any pretense at connecting to the old classes, but I wish to retain a much greater connection than that. It is simply that, more than anything, I wish to streamline some of the powers, bring them in line with my own sensibilities and implied setting, and explore some of my own ideas. By streamline, I do mean to remove as many Powers as possible by combining them, crunching them down and translating them into other aspects of the system (as already done with the Battlemaster Fighter into Tactical Actions).

This does also imply a future change to spells with pretty much the same approach (remove, combine and translate), but we'll get to that, and whether and by how much it would be necessary, later. Which I have actually started work on, if only behind the scenes.

### Power Sets
An idea for Power rewriting Powers is to guide myself by organising Powers under themed Sets (no totally not classes). A set may be a tree, an inverse tree, or just a grouping. Each set can then have a tag to help navigation and discovery of Powers.

- Focus Set - Powers for enhancing tactical actions and Focus. Note, put certain tactical actions into this.
- Patronage Set - for Pact Magic and friends
  - Invocations - although it would be good to unwrap this set back up into patronage
- Fighting Styles
- Powerful - name to be confirmed. The "level up" set. These are the powers that in a rather absolute sense improve character power, so combining them under one tag allows one "Powerful" Power to be taken per X Powers without overlap. Those would be access to higher level spells, more Health, and Extra Attack. Also create "Heavy Attack" as a foil to Extra Attack: heavy attacks deal twice the damage when using Strength, extra attacks allow you to do more than one attack per action when using Dexterity / Accuracy. Also an "Empowered Cantrips" Power to replace 5th/11th/17th character level power bump.

#### Power Requirements
On an unrelated note, I've sat down to set out the framework for Power Requirements, so it can be programmed for a proper build system be built, where Players only see the powers they qualify for (and to have fun features like a character randomizer that actually produces legal results). The character creator also needs to factor in changes to a character caused by Powers, such as skills, expertise marking, Stat increases etc, which means that when deselecting a Power, first the new state must be checked to see if the current powers still qualify and if invalid, ignore the deselect. Or better yet, display in some way that the power is not deselectable.

##### TODO
- mark all Stat-boosting & skill granting Powers with that data in ther json for the character creator to read out
- for resource powers, when selected they need to flag that the associated powers have a cost of 1
- many powers can be taken more than once. Make this possible.
- Sorcerous Origin and Occult Spellcasting is a special case and needs proper handling. Mana becomes a required pick but retro-actively.
- Powers that grant Skills at Expertise are marked with *, just Skill proficiency (no mark) or Skill proficiency or Expertise if already earned with ^
- Skill/Stat increase choices need to be handled. Currently set as either using the "Any" keyword or an array of choices
- Powers that can be taken multiple times that scale their prerequisites, the scaling needs to be machine readable in some way. Starting with RANK as a keyword (i.e. Dexterity +RANK).

Skills are set on power by skill attribute which leads to an object of {core, knowledge, martial} mirroring how the pedd-skill object works like:

```json
"skill": {
    "core":[["Arcana*", "History*", "Nature*", "Religion*"], ["Arcana*", "History*", "Nature*", "Religion*"]],
    "knowledge": "Language (Any)",
    "martial": ["Blade^", "Bows^", "Mauls^" "Rogue^"]
}
```

Actually the above needs to change to accomodate skill choices between arrays that cover more than one skill category

Also there are special names for "Any Martial", "Any", and "Current^" which means upgrade any Current Skill from Proficiency to Expertise

- SkillName^ skill Proficiency or upgrade to Expertise if already earned
- SkillName* skill at Expertise

For Stats:
- stat-change: { stat: val etc.} - note that stat can be the statistics or the secondaries like speed
- stat-max: {stat: val etc.}

Prerequisite groupings:
- {Power name}
- {Stat name} {value}
- {Name} Skill / {Name} Expertise
- {Name} Cantrip / {Name} Spell
- "Once every Nth Role Power"
- "After N Role Powers"
- One of (the above / separated / by / forward-slashes)

### Simulation
So begins the idea of adding everything needed to powers to fully simulate them in a virtual tabletop.

As I make my way through the Powers I'll make a note of the sections here and my thoughts for there use on simulation.

```json "actions": ["array", "of", "action", "names"] ``` will give a list of actions a character can do on their turn (in addition to base)
```json "bonus-actions": ["array", "of", "action", "names"] ``` as above, but for bonus actions. includes if actions are now bonus actions
```json "cool-down": { "short" : 3 } ``` an object with different prop-values for different periods and numbers of times of use per period. Probs just a very high value for "infinite" or negative and check on val == 0

or, you know, I'm just making a tonne of work for myself for basically no reason.
