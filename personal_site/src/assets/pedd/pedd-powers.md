## Power Progression & Magic
In a move I've wanted to do since I've ever started tweaking 5e and messing around with my own RPG's, I introduce an abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replacing it with "Powers" (created from Features and Feats). The intent is to allow for any combination of Features to be allowed for all sorts of different and unique characters, and to replace levelling with a more story-driven Power by Power progression system.

### Powers
A Power is, in the old parlance, a 'feature'; an ability of a character to do something extraordinary beyond the day-to-day ken of your normal person. Whether that be to do something but better, do something that was otherwise impossible or grant access to something in addition to usual routes, Powers as the name implies empower you to adventure!

Powers follow certain rules for their acquisition and use. Most Powers have Prerequisites that you must meet before taking them, with those with none being freely available to all. Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of higher prerequisites, typically Stats, the presence of other Powers, and also “After n or more Powers” or "Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power", meaning n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken, and the same again if taking this power again. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

For example (as both Hardy and Hale are "Once every 4<sup>th</sup> Power" Powers), the following is a valid combination of Powers:
1. Hardy I
2. Hale I
3. Second Wind
4. Fighting Style - Mariner
5. Hardy II
6. Hale II

**Note**: Powers that allow you to take another Power such as Fighting Style's fighting-styles or Divine Domain's miracles do not count toward the number of Powers you have for prerequisite reasons. These natural sub-categories of Powers are tagged for ease of access.

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers. Many Powers describe the differences that occur when the Power is taken more than once.

Unless a Power is labelled with "Once every nth Power" or "Repeatable" it cannot be taken more than once. It is unique. (TODO - make sure this is the case)

#### Tags
Powers come with tags for ease of perusal and understanding. Here they are, explained:
- **Racial** – Powers that can only be gained from being a certain Race, representing in-born racial abilities that you couldn't gain no matter how much you train, and can only be taken during character creation. Some Powers a race can choose from as a Racial power are Background Powers, as conceivably any race if in a position (i.e. background) to study them could do so and could learn them, then they ought not be racial powers.
- **Background** - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background, the skills and abilities of your childhood and professional life before becoming an adventurer
- **Cantrip** - a Power that grants the ability to use a cantrip without needing Spellcasting
- **Combat** / **Exploration** / **Social** / **Universal** - used in the respective pillar of play or in all. Only Powers that belong to a Resource aren't labelled with one.
- Combat has the following sub tags (at least one), as its such a significant pillar of play in terms of game design: 
  - **Offensive** - damaging effects against a target or targets, direct or indirect through saves
  - **Defensive** - effects that increase Defence or in otherwise help protect the character
    - **Damage Reduction** - a further subcategory of defense where the Power grants Resistance (half damage to certain damage types) or Immunity (0 damage from certain damage types)
  - **Crowd-Control** - non-damaging effects that hinder the target
  - **Movement** - increases the movement capability of the character
  - **Healing** - restores health or temporary health to yourself or a target
  - **Utility** - an ancilliary effect that is none of the above
- **Stat** - a Stat increasing Power
  - **Health** - a subcategory of Stat, where Health is increased
- **Sense** - a Power that enhances the senses of the character in some way
- **Skill** - a Power that grants a proficiency Bonus or Expertise, or some other effect towards a Skill
- **Spellcasting** - a Power that grants the knowledge of and ability to cast certain spells, or is one of the fully-fledged XYZ Spellcasting Powers and the Mana Power that fuels them.
- **Spell-like** - a Power that grants the abilties and effects of a spell, without the knowledge of that spell or indeed without necessarily using magic at all, as the Power could be inborn ability, chemical knowledge or any other number of means to produce a spell-like effect.
- **Roll-Effecting** - used to modify a dice roll, such as grant a Bonus, flat value, Advantage or Disadvantage
- **Healing** - inc self-healing, combat health recovery
- **Recovery** - recovery of health and resources outside combat.
- **Resource** - a Power that gives access to a pool of thematically related powers, each of which are tagged for convenience. Current resources are: fighting-styles, invocations, ki powers, meta-magics, miracles (through Divine Domain's Channel Divinity), patrons, and sorcerous-origins. These do not count towards your total number of powers, but each Power taken through the resource does.
- **Passive** - a flat bonus to an aspect of the game
- **Utility** - a.k.a. a ribbon ability, some other effect that enhances who you are as a character and otherwise not fitting into the above non-pillar categories

#### Powers In Training
Powers are “in-training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power.

The amount of time needed for a Power is thematic, and depends on the pace of the game being played, your table's position on the arcade-to-simulation scale, and of course the Power itself. Many PEDD Powers also refer to being able to learn other Powers at an "increased rate". By default you can think of this as halving the amount of time, though again it depends on the table and style of play at hand.

### Spheres of Magic
Spellcasting has undergone a serious remake. Gone are spell casting classes, of course, and spell lists for each class. Now all spell lists are combined into 4 “Spheres of Magic”; Arcane, Divine, Primal and Occult. The nebulous "Spellcasting" feature has been separated into 5 different spellcasting Powers, one for each Sphere as well as one for Pact Magic. Each are fundamentally unique and not just because of the associated spell list and minor quirks, adding both flavour and mechanical differentiation. 

Note that there is significant overlap for the spheres, many spells belong to, and are usable by, more than one sphere.

#### Mana Magnitude and Reserve
Spell levels and spell slots have also received a semantic rework as can be seen in the 'Mana' Power, as the naming convention is old and counter-productive. Countless times I've had new players get confused about levels, spell levels and how spell slots . Now admittedly with the removal of classes and character levels, I could have left spell levels in without ambiguity, but I didn't as apparently I'm anethema to levels. Spell levels are relabelled to "Magnitude" and spell slots to "Reserve". A spellcaster has a "X Reserve of Y Magnitude", with one spell use being simply known as a "Cast", one use of a magnitude of reserve. This also translates well when talking about "up-casting".

#### Innate Spells, and Prepared Spells & Sources
Another semantic rework is "Prepared" spellcasting and spellcasting with "Known spells". Now there are explicit Innate and Prepared Spells. "Innate spells" are learned spells memorised or made reflexive by the caster, they never need to be prepared. All Cantrips, for example, are Innate (and also take 0 Reserve to Cast). Prepared spells then, to Spheres that can, allow a spell caster to Prepare a spell they don't otherwise have ready for use. The manner and method a spell is Prepared depends on the Sphere, but it means the caster can choose from any Spell they have access to in their "Source":

- The source of Arcane spells is the wizard’s spellbook, which they accrue over time by writing down Arcane Sphere spells they encounter and invent.
- The source of Divine spells are that devotee's deity. This is a spell list which the deity, in all their wisdom and might, chooses for the day from all the Divine Sphere spells. Ultimately the DM, somewhat knowing the future with their preparation and who acts as the deity in question, produces a subset of the divine sphere which the character can then choose from. Alternatively the DM and player check whether the spell list the player wants for that day is OK by the Diety (the DM). It might be that, for a given day, a deity requires a character to prepare a particular spell.
- Primal spells can be sourced from the entire primal sphere of magic, but it is fundamentally limited in breadth and scope compared to the others so this seeming advantage is still balanced.

#### The Arcane Sphere
> Spell list - Artificer, Wizard

Arcane magic practitioners, commonly called wizards, are your typical learned mage. They collect a large repertoire of Prepared spells in their Spellbook; and through intense study can memorise the immense complexities of a select few spells, making that spell Innate for them. Famously, wizards are known to invent spells [choosing any spell from the Arcane Sphere or working with the GM to craft custom spells] as a down time activity.

See the Arcane Spellcasting Power (which is largely unchanged from Wizard's Spellcasting).

#### The Divine Sphere
 > Spell list - Cleric, Paladin

Divine Magic is that which is bestowed upon loyal followers by divine beings and auspicious fates. Divine spell casters can have innate spells, their so-called "domain" spells, and prepared spells. Uniquely, Divine spells are cast using an entirely separate statistic: Faith, which becomes a new Stat for characters with access to the Divine Sphere. 

When a character takes any Power that gives them access to Divine spells, they must add the Faith Stat to their character sheet. They must also note to which deity or cause their Faith belongs, and therefore have a rough idea of what it means to be faithful to that cause, to uphold its virtues and abhor its vices. It starts at +2, but due to character actions, with player collaboration, the DM can choose to increase or decrease the Stat, typically by 1 in either direction during monumental actions that go for or against the faith. It is expected for Faith to change once every 2-6 sessions.

#### The Primal Sphere
> Spell list - Druid, Ranger

Primal Magic is driven by the user's connection to the power of nature, wherever it is they find themselves. At the end of each Long Rest the caster must, in addition to preparing spells, commune with nature to be empowered by the 'Verdance' of the current locale. Consult the Verdance table below, also found in the "Primal Spellcasting" Power, and your DM to calculate the Verdance you use for your Primal Spells in the coming day, as well as any Powers that modify the Verdance you can access.

#### Verdance Table
| Verdance | Boreal | Coastal | Deserts | Forests | Jungles | Plains | Mountains | Swamps | Underground |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barren   | -1 | 1 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 |
| Poor     | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Middling | 1 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Rich     | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Abundant | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 |

The Primal Mage can freely choose from the entire Primal Sphere when preparing spells, limited as it is. Life is consistent in its tenacity, so is life magic. Limited in scope but steady in power, caring little for the whims of the individual, but implaccable in its march.

#### The Occult Sphere
> Spell list - Bard, Sorcerer & Warlock

Occult magic is that which refutes study, bends logic and breaks minds. Those that practice it rarely chose to do so, or came to use it through a myriad of unorthodox ways. Such spells are always Innate; esoteric knowledge carved into the mind and body of the Sorcerer. It is not prepared, or one might say it is prepared into their very bodies. 

Occult spellcasting uses Fortitude, Reflexes or Willpower, halved and rounded up, to cast spells: depending on the spell's school, as they rely on their bodies to conjure the magic. 
- **Fortitude** - Abjuration, Conjuration and Enchantment
- **Reflexes** - Illusion, Transmutation
- **Willpower** - Divination, Evocation, Necromancy

#### Pact Magic
Pact Magic, while clearly occult in nature, functions quite differently to other spellcasting Powers, as fundamentally the magic is derived from some other powerful individual known as a *Patron* who entrusts power into their vassal. Not all who have a Patron are provided with magic, as the character might not have the Pact Magic Power, but one needs a Patron with whom to make a pact in order to access the magics that come as part of that pact.

Patrons are known to plug their warlocks with all sorts of spells of varied yet thematic spells, with each Patron presenting a unique spell list: one of the sphere's as a base plus a number of "emblematic spells" added to that list, and "anethema spells" that may be removed. Patrons are also known to change what spells they imbibe their followers with during periods of communion, and so Pact Magic is the only kind known to change spells during a Downtime Activity period, rather than a Rest or not at all as is the case with Innate Spells.

As in the base game, Pact Magic is also notable for its vastly different spellcasting resource. It avoids the need for Mana. Instead, the warlock has a well of power that is known as their “Stipend”, that “Recharges” after a Short Rest, unlike other Spellcasting which uses Mana Reserve that returns on a Long Rest. 

Lastly, the Spellcasting Ability that governs the magic casting is also dictated by the Patron.

None: Pact Magic does not count as one of the 'Spellcasting' Powers for the purpose of the 'spellcasting' prerequisite of some Powers (which is why it doesn't have that tag).

#### Archfey

**Spellcasting Ability** - [Verdance](#-verdance-table). Additionally if your reside, spending more time than not, in a single region for a lunar month, the Verdance of that region increases by a stage (unless it is already Abundant). After this, if you leave, it reverts to the previous stage over the course of a lunar month.

#### Spell Schools
Spell schools are another vestigial part of the D&D system, but I think they're actually quite interesting and deserve a bit more love. Now many Powers key specifically off a spell's school, notably Occult Spellcasting and my Goblinoid's race, hopefully making them more interesting and useful!

#### Spell-like and Spellcasting Powers
Many Powers grant "spellcasting", where the character learns spells and through Mana or the details of the Power, can cast them at certain Magnitudes. Some Powers grant "spell-like" abilities where the effect of the Power is the same as the state spell, but the character does *not* know the spell outright, meaning that if they gain Mana they still cannot "cast" the spell, as it were. Spell-like Powers can be thought of as independent access to the spell, or even physical and mental abilities that bring about coincidentally the same effect. After all, it is said many scholars craft spells to mimic supernatural phenomena and abilities of powerful creatures.

### *Example Powers*
**Artisan** – gain proficiency in a Tool Set and proficiency in a Skill. You also gain Expertise in a Tool Set. When not at Disadvantage, you can choose to not roll when making any Tool Set check and instead assume you rolled a 10, adding Stat and any Bonus to that as normal.
