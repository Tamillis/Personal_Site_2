## Power Progression & Magic
In a move I've wanted to do since I've ever started tweaking 5e and messing around with my own RPG's, I introduce an abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replacing it with "Powers" (created from Features and Feats). The intent is to allow for any combination of Features to be allowed for all sorts of different and unique characters, and to replace levelling with a more story-driven Power by Power progression system.

Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of prerequisites, typically Stats, the presence of other Powers, and also “After n or more Powers” or "Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power", meaning n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken, and the same again if taking this power again. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers.

This means (as both Hearty and Hale are "Once every 2<sup>nd</sup> Power" Powers) the following is a valid combination of Powers:
1. Brawler
2. Hearty I
3. Hale I
4. Hearty II
5. Hale II

As has already been listed, some Powers have some meta categories:
- Racial Powers – inborn powers that cannot be trained in normal progression and can only be taken during character creation
- Background Powers - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background
- Unique Powers - those that can only be taken once
- Difficult - Powers that take longer than usual to learn

Some Powers, like Invocations and Miracles, form natural categories of their own and are tagged for ease of access.

#### Powers In Training
Powers are “in training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power.

The amount of time needed for a Power is thematic, and depends on the pace of the game being played, its place on the game-to-simulation scale, and of course the Power itself. Many PEDD Powers also refer to being able to learn other Powers at an "increased rate". By default you can think of this as halving the amount of time, though again it depends on the table and style of play at hand.

### Spheres of Magic
Spellcasting has undergone a serious remake. Gone are spell casting classes, of course, and spell lists for each class. Now all spell lists are combined into 4 “Spheres of Magic”; Arcane, Divine, Primal and Occult. The nebulous "Spellcasting" feature has been separated into 5 different spellcasting Powers, one for each Sphere as well as one for Pact Magic. Each are fundamentally unique and not just because of the associated spell list, adding both flavour and mechanical differentiation. Note that there is significant overlap for the spheres, many spells belong to, and are usable by, more than one sphere.

#### Mana Magnitude and Reserve
Spell levels and spell slots have also received a semantic rework, as the naming convention is old and counter-productive. Countless times I've had new players get confused about levels, spell levels and how spell slots work. Spell levels are relabelled to "Magnitude" and spell slots to "Reserve". A spellcaster has a "Mana Reserve of X Magnitude Y Casts", with one spell cast being simply known as a "Cast". This also translates well when talking about "up-casting".

#### Innate Spells, and Prepared Spells & Sources
Another semantic rework is "Prepared" spellcasting and spellcasting with "Known spells". Now there are explicit Innate and Prepared Spells. "Innate spells" are learned spells memorised or made reflexive by the caster, they never need to be prepared. All Cantrips, for example, are Innate (and also take 0 Reserve to Cast). Prepared spells then, to Spheres that can, allow a spell caster to Prepare a spell they don't otherwise have ready for use. The manner and method a spell is Prepared depends on the Sphere, but it means the caster can choose from any Spell they have access to in their "Source":

- The source of Arcane spells is the wizard’s spellbook, which they accrue over time by writing down Arcane Sphere spells they encounter and invent.
- The source of Divine spells are that devotee's deity. This is a spell list which the deity, in all their wisdom and might, chooses for the day from all the Divine Sphere spells. Ultimately the DM, somewhat knowing the future with their preparation and who acts as the deity in question, produces a subset of the divine sphere which the character can then choose from. Alternatively the DM and player check whether the spell list the player wants for that day is OK by the Diety (the DM). It might be that, for a given day, a deity requires a character to prepare a particular spell.
- Primal spells can be sourced from the entire primal sphere of magic, but it is fundamentally limited in breadth and scope compared to the others so this seeming advantage is still balanced.

#### The Arcane Sphere
(All Wizard spell list spells are available to the Arcane Sphere)

Arcane magic practitioners, commonly called wizards, are your typical learned mage. They collect a large repertoire of Prepared spells in their Spellbook; and through intense study can memorise the immense complexities of a select few spells, making that spell Innate for them. Famously, wizards are known to invent spells [choosing any spell from the Arcane Sphere or working with the GM to craft custom spells] as a down time activity.

See the Arcane Spellcasting Power (which is largely unchanged from Wizard's Spellcasting).

#### The Divine Sphere
(All Cleric & Paladin spell lists spells are available to the Divine Sphere)

Divine Magic is that which is bestowed upon loyal followers by divine beings and auspicious fates. Divine spell casters can have innate spells, their so-called "domain" spells, and prepared spells. Uniquely, Divine spells are cast using an entirely separate statistic: Faith, which becomes a new Stat for characters with access to the Divine Sphere. 

When a character takes any Power that gives them access to Divine spells, they must add the Faith Stat to their character sheet. They must also note to which deity or cause their Faith belongs, and therefore have a rough idea of what it means to be faithful to that cause, to uphold its virtues and abhor its vices. It starts at +2, but due to character actions, with player collaboration, the DM can choose to increase or decrease the Stat, typically by 1 in either direction during monumental actions that go for or against the faith. It is expected for Faith to change every few sessions.

#### The Primal Sphere
(Druid & Ranger spell lists)

Primal Magic is driven by the user's connection to the power of nature, wherever it is they find themselves. At the end of each Long Rest the caster must, in addition to preparing spells, commune with nature to be empowered by the 'Verdance' of the current locale. Consult the Verdance table below, also found in the "Primal Spellcasting" Power, and your DM to calculate the Verdance you use for your Primal Spells in the coming day, as well as any Powers that modify the Verdance you can access.

| Verdance | Boreal | Coastal | Deserts | Forests | Jungles | Plains | Mountains | Swamps | Underground |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barren   | -1 | 1 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 |
| Poor     | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Middling | 1 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Rich     | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Abundant | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 |

The Primal Mage can freely choose from the entire Primal Sphere when preparing spells, limited as it is. Life is consistent in its tenacity, so is life magic. Limited in scope but steady in power, caring little for the whims of the individual, but implaccable in its march.

#### The Occult Sphere
(Bard, Sorcerer & Warlock spell lists)

Occult magic is that which refutes study, bends logic and breaks minds. Those that practice it rarely chose to do so, or came to use it through a myriad of unorthodox ways. Such spells are always Innate; esoteric knowledge carved into the mind and body of the Sorcerer. Occult spellcasting uses Charisma, one's force of personality, to wield the magic.

#### Pact Magic
Pact Magic while clearly is occult in nature, functions quite differently to other spellcasting Powers, as fundamentally the magic is derived from some other powerful individual known as a *Patron*. Not all who have the Patron power are provided with magic, the Pact Magic Power, but one needs a Patron to have Pact Magic.

Patrons are known to plug their warlocks with all sorts of spells, with each Patron presenting a unique spell list (often using one of the Spheres as a basis) including innate spells. Warlocks may have a few extra innate spells they pick up from Eldritch Invocations, other Spellcasting or so on, but generally Pact Magic is much more limited. The Reserve of Pact Magic is also known as their “Stipend” that “Recharges” after a Break, unlike other Spellcasting which requires a Rest, and the mental Stat that governs the magic casting is also dictated by the Patron; Charisma, Perception or Intelligence. 

#### Spell Schools
Spell schools are another vestigial part of the D&D system, but I think they're actually quite interesting and deserve a bit more love. Now many Powers key specifically off a spell's school, hopefully making them more interesting and useful!
