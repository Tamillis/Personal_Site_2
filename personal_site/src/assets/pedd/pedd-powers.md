## Powers
In a move I've wanted to do since I've ever started tweaking 5e, I introduce an abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replacing it with "Powers" (created from D&D 5e SRD Features, Feats, Spells and from whole-cloth). The intent is to allow for any combination of Powers to be allowed for all sorts of different and unique characters, and to replace levelling with a more story-driven powers "In-Training" progression system, where characters discover, train in and then unleash Powers.

A Power is, in the old parlance, a 'feature'; an ability of a character to do something extraordinary beyond the day-to-day ken of your normal person. Whether that be to do something but better, do something that was otherwise impossible or grant access to something in addition to usual routes. Powers - as the name implies - empower you to adventure!

I have also taken this opportunity to reduce the amount of nitpick and special pleading many features used to come with, where a lot of powers would work in similar but not quite the same ways, making it difficult to recall exactly how anything worked unless you'd memorised every little iota. I seek to inject balance and consistency, as well as also making every Power on roughly equal footing in terms of impact, so that each is worth taking in its own right: cutting down or even combining some of the more superfluous ribbon abilities, buffing others, and bringing everything in line.

Part of that consistency is in the presentation of those Powers. Every Power has a Name, Tags, Prerequisites (if any), and its Description which holds the meat of the matter. Under the hood any additions to the character are also tracked, which doubles in making sure that Powers would in sane and consistent ways: such as gaining proficiency, stat increases, spell access etc.

### Progression and Powers In Training
Progression in PEDD is a dynamic and natural thing. Players and characters identify the next Power they wish to make theirs, and are said to be “in-training”. The GM and the player decide how much training, what kind, and any other prerequisites ought to be required for their game and setting, before the Power comes online. A recommended practice is to, as a GM, have players "training" Powers that make sense to be slowly building up in the background, and after each monumental step in the story bring that Power online, as well as scatter Powers through their story, rewarding them almost like loot. The idea of this system is to encourage roleplay as well as mechanical progress acquisition, as well as literally empowering the beats of the story.

> E.g. a player at the start of a campaign chapter declares that their character is training for the Blind Fighting Power. During the various rests and downtimes, they describe how their character puts on a blind-fold and trains themselves, sparring with their allies, grabbing arrows shot through the air, and hours spent meditating in the darkness. As they reach the climax of the chapter, slaying a great beast that has made its roost in an old temple, the GM describes how, during the last fight itself, all that training starts to click just when its needed most, and the character gains Blind Fighting. With the defeat of the beast, the GM describes how an emmissary of the God of this old temple descends, thanking them for helping clear even an old and forgotten place like this of evil, and offers to bestow a boon on the character. They then gain the Portent Power.

The amount of time needed for a Power is thematic and not noted on the power itself: it depends on the pace of the game being played, your table's position on the arcade-to-simulation scale, and of course the Power itself. Many PEDD Powers also refer to being able to learn other Powers at an "increased rate". By default you can think of this as halving the amount of time, though again it depends on the table and style of play at hand.

As a guide, think of two key bits of information: what is the intensitiy of the training required and how long should the trianing be. I envision 3 stages of intensity: a power that requires full time study (think like a 9-5 job), a power that requires part-time study (such as over the weekend), and powers that can be learnt in a hobby-like fashion, just an hour or so a day. Given that intensity, how long should each Power take? A day? A month? A year? The GM and table are encouraged to fluff this number as approriate to the Power, the character and the situation, and of course, for what is fun to play.

One aspect of the intention behind the training design is that a character can have multiple powers "in training" at once, based on the different levels of intensity. There's no reason a character couldn't be training 9-5 on their body to earn the Statistic Increase Power with the goal of improving their Strength, whilst also drilling the weekends to hone their soothing music to train 'Song of Rest', and during a quiet hour each day work on their skills to be more 'Skilled'.

### Ranks
Some powers can be taken more than once, so you should note what "Rank" they are at; such as "Health Increase I" or "Health Increase IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers. Many rankable Powers describe differences that occur when the Power is taken more than once.

### Prerequisites
For those Powers that have Prerequisites, your character must meet them before taking the Power, with those with none being freely available to all. While each Powers should be worth taking in its own right, certain Powers will be stronger than others, which is why prerequisites come in to play.

Prerequisites are <a id="toggle-preqs">(Click here to show)</a>:

<section id="preqs-section" class="hidden">

- a certain Stat at a certain Value
- the presence of other Powers
- After N Powers - Many such "punchy" Powers use this, meaning n number of other Powers must first be taken before this Power can be taken
- Once every N<sup>th</sup> Power - which means the Power can be taken multiple times, but only after N other Powers have been taken. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".
- a Skill or Expertise in a Skill
- a Cantrip or Spell known
- One of A OR B - any of the above prerequisites, only obviously one or the other (or however many in the chain) are needed.

### Tags
Powers come with tags for ease of perusal and understanding. These are based on mechanical effects and natural categories, for easier browsing. The explanation for each tag is also given below.

Tags are <a id="toggle-tags">(Click here to show)</a>:

<section id="tags-section" class="hidden"> 

- **Racial** - Powers that can only be gained from being a certain Race, representing in-born racial abilities that you couldn't gain no matter how much you train, and can only be taken during character creation. Some Powers a race can choose from as a Racial power are Background Powers, as conceivably any race if in a position (i.e. background) to study them could do so and could learn them, then they ought not be racial powers.
- **Background** - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background, the skills and abilities of your childhood and professional life before becoming an adventurer
- **Cantrip** - a Power that grants the ability to use a cantrip without needing Spellcasting
- **Combat** / **Exploration** / **Social** / **Universal** - used in the respective pillar of play or in all. Only Powers that belong to a Resource aren't labelled with one.
- Combat has the following sub tags (at least one), as its such a significant pillar of play in terms of game design: 
  - **Offensive** - damaging effects against a target or targets, direct or indirect through saves
  - **Defensive** - effects that increase Defence or in otherwise help protect the character
    - **Damage Reduction** - a further subcategory of defense where the Power grants Resistance (half damage to certain damage types) or Immunity (0 damage from certain damage types)
  - **Crowd-Control** - non-damaging effects that hinder the target
  - **Movement** - increases the movement capability of the character
  - **Healing** - restores health or temporary health to yourself or a target
  - **Temporary-Health** - provides an amount of Temporary Health that lasts until the next Long Rest, you gain more Temporary Health from another source (keeping whichever is greater), or you take damage enough to drain it
  - **Utility** - an ancilliary effect that is none of the above
- **Stat** - a Stat increasing Power
  - **Health** - a subcategory of Stat, where Health is increased
- **Sense** - a Power that enhances the senses of the character in some way
- **Skill** - a Power that grants a proficiency Bonus or Expertise, or some other effect towards a Skill
- **Spellcasting** - a Power that grants the knowledge of and ability to cast certain spells, or is one of the fully-fledged XYZ Spellcasting Powers and the Mana Power that fuels them.
- **Spell-like** - a Power that grants the abilties and effects of a spell, without the knowledge of that spell or indeed without necessarily using magic at all, as the Power could be inborn ability, chemical knowledge or any other number of means to produce a spell-like effect.
- **Roll-Effecting** - used to modify a dice roll, such as grant a Bonus, flat value, Advantage or Disadvantage
- **Healing** - inc self-healing, combat health recovery
- **Recovery** - recovery of health and resources outside combat.
- **Resource** - a Power that gives access to a pool of thematically related powers, each of which are tagged for convenience. Current resources are: fighting-styles, invocations, ki powers, meta-magics, miracles (through Divine Domain's Channel Divinity), patrons, and sorcerous-origins. These do not count towards your total number of powers, but each Power taken through the resource does.
- **Passive** - a flat bonus to an aspect of the game
- **Utility** - a.k.a. a ribbon ability, some other effect that enhances who you are as a character and otherwise not fitting into the above non-pillar categories
