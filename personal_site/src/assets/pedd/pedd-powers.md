## Powers
In a move I've wanted to do since I've ever started tweaking 5e and messing around with my own RPG's, I introduce an abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replacing it with "Powers" (created from Features and Feats). The intent is to allow for any combination of Features to be allowed for all sorts of different and unique characters, and to replace levelling with a more story-driven Power by Power progression system, where characters discover, train in and then unleash Powers.

A Power is, in the old parlance, a 'feature'; an ability of a character to do something extraordinary beyond the day-to-day ken of your normal person. Whether that be to do something but better, do something that was otherwise impossible or grant access to something in addition to usual routes, Powers - as the name implies - empower you to adventure!

Powers follow certain rules for their acquisition and use. Most Powers have Prerequisites that you must meet before taking them, with those with none being freely available to all. Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of higher prerequisites such as Stats or the presence of other Powers. Many such "punchy" Powers also have the prerequisites “After n or more Powers”, meaning n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken again, or "Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power" which is the same again except the first investment of this Power can be taken immediately. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

For example (as both Hardy and Hale are "Once every 4<sup>th</sup> Power" Powers), the following is a valid combination of Powers:
1. Hardy I
2. Hale I
3. Second Wind
4. Fighting Style - Mariner
5. Hardy II
6. Hale II

**Note**: Powers that allow you to take another Power such as Fighting Style's fighting-styles or Divine Domain's miracles do not count toward the number of Powers you have for prerequisite reasons. These natural sub-categories of Powers are tagged for ease of access.

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers. Many Powers describe the differences that occur when the Power is taken more than once.

#### Powers In Training
Powers are “in-training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power. Alternatively, play make indicate a certain Power a character should take next as a natural next progression.

The amount of time needed for a Power is thematic, and depends on the pace of the game being played, your table's position on the arcade-to-simulation scale, and of course the Power itself. Many PEDD Powers also refer to being able to learn other Powers at an "increased rate". By default you can think of this as halving the amount of time, though again it depends on the table and style of play at hand.


#### Tags
Powers come with tags for ease of perusal and understanding. <a id="toggle-tags">Click here for explanation</a>:

<section id="tag-section" class="hidden"> 

- **Racial** – Powers that can only be gained from being a certain Race, representing in-born racial abilities that you couldn't gain no matter how much you train, and can only be taken during character creation. Some Powers a race can choose from as a Racial power are Background Powers, as conceivably any race if in a position (i.e. background) to study them could do so and could learn them, then they ought not be racial powers.
- **Background** - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background, the skills and abilities of your childhood and professional life before becoming an adventurer
- **Cantrip** - a Power that grants the ability to use a cantrip without needing Spellcasting
- **Combat** / **Exploration** / **Social** / **Universal** - used in the respective pillar of play or in all. Only Powers that belong to a Resource aren't labelled with one.
- Combat has the following sub tags (at least one), as its such a significant pillar of play in terms of game design: 
  - **Offensive** - damaging effects against a target or targets, direct or indirect through saves
  - **Defensive** - effects that increase Defence or in otherwise help protect the character
    - **Damage Reduction** - a further subcategory of defense where the Power grants Resistance (half damage to certain damage types) or Immunity (0 damage from certain damage types)
  - **Crowd-Control** - non-damaging effects that hinder the target
  - **Movement** - increases the movement capability of the character
  - **Healing** - restores health or temporary health to yourself or a target
  - **Utility** - an ancilliary effect that is none of the above
- **Stat** - a Stat increasing Power
  - **Health** - a subcategory of Stat, where Health is increased
- **Sense** - a Power that enhances the senses of the character in some way
- **Skill** - a Power that grants a proficiency Bonus or Expertise, or some other effect towards a Skill
- **Spellcasting** - a Power that grants the knowledge of and ability to cast certain spells, or is one of the fully-fledged XYZ Spellcasting Powers and the Mana Power that fuels them.
- **Spell-like** - a Power that grants the abilties and effects of a spell, without the knowledge of that spell or indeed without necessarily using magic at all, as the Power could be inborn ability, chemical knowledge or any other number of means to produce a spell-like effect.
- **Roll-Effecting** - used to modify a dice roll, such as grant a Bonus, flat value, Advantage or Disadvantage
- **Healing** - inc self-healing, combat health recovery
- **Recovery** - recovery of health and resources outside combat.
- **Resource** - a Power that gives access to a pool of thematically related powers, each of which are tagged for convenience. Current resources are: fighting-styles, invocations, ki powers, meta-magics, miracles (through Divine Domain's Channel Divinity), patrons, and sorcerous-origins. These do not count towards your total number of powers, but each Power taken through the resource does.
- **Passive** - a flat bonus to an aspect of the game
- **Utility** - a.k.a. a ribbon ability, some other effect that enhances who you are as a character and otherwise not fitting into the above non-pillar categories
