### Tags
Powers come with tags for ease of perusal and understanding. These are based on mechanical effects and natural categories, for easier browsing. The explanation for each tag is also given below.

Tags are <a id="toggle-tags">(Click here to show)</a>:

<section id="tags-section" class="hidden"> 

- **Racial** - Powers that can only be gained from being a certain Race, representing in-born racial abilities that you couldn't gain no matter how much you train, and can only be taken during character creation. Some Powers a race can choose from as a Racial power are Background Powers, as conceivably any race if in a position (i.e. background) to study them could do so and could learn them, then they ought not be racial powers.
- **Background** - so called "simpler" Powers that can be taken as part of your Background, the skills and abilities of your childhood and professional life before becoming an adventurer
- **Cantrip** - a Power that grants the ability to use a cantrip without needing Spellcasting
- **Combat** / **Exploration** / **Social** / **Universal** - used in the respective pillar of play or in all. Only Powers that belong to a Resource aren't labelled with one.
- Combat has the following sub tags (at least one), as its such a significant pillar of play in terms of game design: 
  - **Offensive** - damaging effects against a target or targets, direct or indirect through saves
  - **Defensive** - effects that increase Defence or in otherwise help protect the character
    - **Damage Reduction** - a further subcategory of defense where the Power grants Resistance (half damage to certain damage types) or Immunity (0 damage from certain damage types)
  - **Crowd-Control** - non-damaging effects that hinder the target
  - **Movement** - increases the movement capability of the character
  - **Healing** - restores health or temporary health to yourself or a target
  - **Temporary-Health** - provides an amount of Temporary Health that lasts until the next Long Rest, you gain more Temporary Health from another source (keeping whichever is greater), or you take damage enough to drain it
  - **Utility** - an ancilliary effect that is none of the above
- **Stat** - a Stat increasing Power
  - **Health** - a subcategory of Stat, where Health is increased
- **Sense** - a Power that enhances the senses of the character in some way
- **Skill** - a Power that grants a proficiency Bonus or Expertise, or some other effect towards a Skill
- **Spellcasting** - a Power that grants the knowledge of and ability to cast certain spells, or is one of the fully-fledged XYZ Spellcasting Powers and the Mana Power that fuels them.
- **Spell-like** - a Power that grants the abilties and effects of a spell, without the knowledge of that spell or indeed without necessarily using magic at all, as the Power could be inborn ability, chemical knowledge or any other number of means to produce a spell-like effect.
- **Roll-Effecting** - used to modify a dice roll, such as grant a Bonus, flat value, Advantage or Disadvantage
- **Healing** - inc self-healing, combat health recovery
- **Recovery** - recovery of health and resources outside combat.
- **Resource** - a Power that gives access to a pool of thematically related powers, each of which are tagged for convenience. Current resources are: fighting-styles, invocations, ki powers, meta-magics, miracles (through Divine Domain's Channel Divinity), patrons, and sorcerous-origins. These do not count towards your total number of powers, but each Power taken through the resource does.
- **Passive** - a flat bonus to an aspect of the game
- **Utility** - a.k.a. a ribbon ability, some other effect that enhances who you are as a character and otherwise not fitting into the above non-pillar categories

### Prerequisites
For those Powers that have Prerequisites, your character must meet them before taking the Power, with those with none being freely available to all. While each Powers should be worth taking in its own right, certain Powers will be stronger than others, which is why prerequisites come in to play.

Prerequisites are <a id="toggle-preqs">(Click here to show)</a>:

<section id="preqs-section" class="hidden">

- a certain Stat at a certain Value
- the presence of other Powers
- After N Powers - Many such "punchy" Powers use this, meaning n number of other Powers must first be taken before this Power can be taken
- Once every N<sup>th</sup> Power - which means the Power can be taken multiple times, but only after N other Powers have been taken. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".
- a Skill or Expertise in a Skill
- a Cantrip or Spell known
- another Power with a tag
- One of A OR B - any of the above prerequisites, only obviously one or the other (or however many in the chain) are needed.
