Trinitas combat is a marked step away from typical OCR and D20 combat systems.

I hope you find it tactical, quick, cooperative and above all, dramatic.

## Combat Rules

### One Action All At Once
All characters in a **Round** of combat have one **Action**, and everyone acts at once, no initiative. No taking "turns". OAAAO!

How on Earth does that work? You might be thinking.

For starters, it is a bit of a misnomer. All characters also have access to Bonus Actions, from various Powers and Spells, in addition to their Action. Movement also does not technically occur at the same time as the other Actions, as it is resolved last (see below), even if it is declared alongside all other Actions in a Round.

However, the main thrust of the system works like this; 
- The GM declares the intentions of enemies in the scene at the start of a Round, just as their movements would give away what they're about to do. See [Hidden Enemy Action](#hidden-enemy-actions) for when this is not the case.
- All players decide among themselves what they're going to do that Round.
- When everyone is happy with their Actions, you "resolve" the Round in whatever order works. Only in the edge case when the order of actions matters does Initiative need to be determined, using an [Initiative Contest](#initiative-contests).

Most Actions, however, can be resolved simultaneously. Attacks for example; two characters just try to hit each other, damage each other, and collapse wounded at the same time if that is what happens.

Bonus Actions are best thought of as 'concurrent actions', happening at the same time and therefore not significantly interrupting the character's main action. 

Reactions are a natural part of the cooperative nature of Action decleration - you see that goblin trying to stab your face, so you reactively raise your shield as a Bonus Action, and stab back at it, etc.

Movement, as mentioned, is special in that it is always resolved last.

Some players may still be thinking while others already know what they want to do. Resolve the actions of the decided players and their engagements (see [Engagement](#engagement) below), and you'll often find the remaining players now know what to do.

#### Hidden Enemy Actions
Only powerful or well-trained enemies will be capable of **Hidden Actions**, where their intentions are not stated by the GM but kept secret. Typically jotted on a slip of overturned paper, until after players commit to their own Actions. Player characters can always attempt to **Discern** enemy moves anyway (see [Tactical Actions](#tactical-actions)), with the GM flipping the paper over and revealing the Action to all players on a success.

#### Initiative Contests
For any situations where the order of actions matters, the two (or more) characters involved roll off with the most appropriate skill, to see who can get the higher value. For "slow" enemies / mooks the DM will just let the players go first. For example; "I try to grab the bag of gold before him", "OK, you and the white dragon need to make a Sleight of Hand Check to see who can snatch it faster."

You can use 1 Focus to add d6 to the roll.

### Combat Actions
So what can that one Action can do? Actions any character can perform are split between Core Combat Actions and a variety of Tactical Actions. Note that many are keyed to "an Attack or Action", so if you have more than one attack from the `Extra Attack` power, you can potentially take more than one "action" on your turn. Note there are several Powers that provide further and enhanced Tactical Actions.

#### Core Combat Actions

- **Attack** - as an Action, you make your Weapon or Spell Attack/s against characters in reach / range. One Attack Action may involve a number of Attacks on a number of targets depending on the weapon, spell or some Power such as Extra Attack. If multiple targets are all within reach / range and you have multiple Attacks as part of the Attack Action, you may freely choose who to direct attacks at. You make Attack Rolls per Attack. Unless otherwise stated, each Attack Action attack is with lethal intent (see Non-Lethal Strike).
  - **Unarmed Strike** - a weapon Attack using your body and the Unarmed Fighting skill, instead of a traditional weapon.
  - **Improvised Strike** - a weapon Attack using a piece of the environment or non-weapon object. Ask your GM for appropriate statistics to use (such as that of the Club).
- **Block** - as a Bonus Action, you raise your shield, or weapon if it has the Block property, to gain the item's Armour bonus to your Defence for this Round. This prevents you using that item as a weapon to attack.
- **Discern** - as an Attack or Action, you can make a Perception check against one enemy whose has a Hidden Action. If successful (the GM will decide the DC), their Action is no longer hidden and everyone in the combat can know.
- **Dodge** - as an Action, you make a Reflex Saving Throw and the result (or your Stationary Defence, if that is higher) replaces your Defence value for the rest of the Round.
- **Go to Cover / Go Prone / Stand** - as a Bonus Action you make yourself Prone, or enter adjacent cover. The Prone condition or being in cover uses Stationary Defence. Prone makes being shot at occur at Disadvantage, and cover is +2/+5 to Defence for half / Â¾ cover respectively (see [Conditions](#conditions)). Going from cover or Prone to standing takes a Stand Bonus Action.
- **Help** - as an Action, you aid an ally in attacking an enemy within your reach. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally Attacks the target this Round, the first Attack is made with Advantage.
- **Hide** - as an Action, you make a Stealth check in an attempt to hide from those you are obscured from (in 3/4's cover or out of line of sight), versus a DC of their passive Perception. If you succeed, you gain the benefits of being Invisible: Attacks against you have Disadvantage, and your Attack has Advantage. When you make an Attack, you are no longer Hidden. If you or others Move such that you are no longer obscured, you are no longer Hidden from them.
- **Interact** - as an Action, you interact, a short series of motions that achieves a simple goal, with something or someone. This includes; giving an unconscious ally a health potion, arranging the runes of a magical interface, frisking a character for weapons, pulling the chains of a pulley, finding a particular page of a book, or creating a rough sketch in the sand
- **Mount / Dismount** - as an Action, you safely get on or get off a mount within your reach.
- **Move** - move your Speed along a path of your choice towards a target. See [Move Action](#move-action) for details.
- **Use** - as a Bonus Action, you make a single motion to use an item or device. This includes: pulling a lever, pushing a button, drinking a potion readily available, sending a signal (hand, flag, flare etc.), or unlocking a chest with a readily available key.

#### Tactical Actions

- **Attack of Opportunity** - if an enemy you're Engaged with moves away from you, you can spend 1 Focus to make an attack on them for free, after which they have moved away and are no longer Engaged with you.
- **Coup de Grace** - when you make a melee Weapon Attack against an Incapacitated target, don't roll for Damage, instead take each dice you would roll (if any) to be the maximum result.
- **Disarm** - as an Attack or Action against an enemy in your Reach holding a weapon or shield, you make an attack roll against the enemy's passive Reflexes. If you succeed, you rip the weapon from their grasp and throw it 10ft in a direction of your choice (this does not count as a thrown weapon attack), to the ground at your feet, or equip it an empty hand of yours.
- **Focussed Strike** - when you make a weapon attack roll against a character, you can spend 1 Focus to add d6 to the roll.
- **Grapple** - as an Attack or Action you attempt to Grapple a Character. You make a Strength check against their passive Fortitude. If you succeed the target Character is Immobilised. On subsequent turns you can maintain the grapple (no additional roll needed) as an Action or end the grapple for free. When Grappling, you can use your Action to Move yourself and the enemy as if going through Difficult Terrain (typically, at half Speed), make yourself and the enemy Prone, or make an Unarmed Strike or Weapon Attack with the 'prone fighting' tag against the grappled character. Despite being Incapacitated, the grappled character can use their Action to attempt to escape the Grapple, making a Strength or Dexterity check (their choice) vs your passive Fortitude, ending the grapple on a success.
- **Lunge** - When you make a melee weapon attack, you can attack at Disadvantage but double your Reach for that attack. You can spend 1 Focus to ignore the Disadvantage.
- **Non-lethal Strike** (a.k.a. Knockout Strike) - you make an Attack Action with the intention to knock unconscious rather than kill. Don't roll for Damage, instead take each dice roll (if any) to have been a 1. If the target reaches 0 Health, they enter the Unconscious condition.
- **Off-Hand Strike** - when you make an Attack Action with a weapon with the Light Property, you may use your Bonus Action to do a second Weapon Attack with the other weapon in your off-hand, which also must have the Light property. This second attack does not benefit from the Statistic to the damage roll.
- **Parry** - if your weapon has the Parry Property and another character damages you with a melee attack, as an Attack or Action, you can make weapon skill check vs the enemy's passive Reflexes. If you succeed, you can reduce the damage by your Dexterity and proficiency Bonus with the weapon (if any), to a minimum of 0.
- **Power Strike** - when you hit a character with a weapon attack, you can spend 1 Focus to add d6 to the damage roll.
- **Shove** - as an Attack or Action you attempt to make an Enemy Prone or move 10ft in a direction of your choice. You make a Strength check against their passive Fortitude.

#### Move Action
The Move Action sees a character move a distance in feet equal to their Speed towards a stated target. This can be in a straight line or other path of their choice, so long as the path is traversible. Like all Actions, they are declared at the same time as everyone else, however they're unique in that they're only resolved at the end, after all other Actions and Engagements (see [Engagement](#engagement).

Difficult terrain doubles the Speed required, with swimming / climbing requiring quadruple the speed, and impassible terrain must be circumnavigated.

When more than one character takes the Move action with respect to other characters' positions, how to resolve movement can get quite confusing quite quickly. As such, when declaring a Move, declare also the 'target' of the movement. When everyone does this generally speaking a natural conclusion where all characters reach or approach their targets becomes clear. 

For example, if we have Mr A, Mr B and Mr C in the awkward face off of A moving to B, B to C and C to A, where does everyone end up? Bunched in the middle: because when viewed through the lense of their targets, the natural result is that they all start moving towards each other (this way, A gets to B, who gets to C, who gets to A). 

<script src="pedd_movement_1.js"></script>
<div id="movement-1-canvas"></div>

Another situation may be: A is moving to B, who is moving to C, who is running away from A. In this case, they all move linearly in the direction of C's flight (which is away from A). 

If it is *not* clear, make an Initiative Contest check to see who goes first, and then resolve in sequence.

### Engagement
To help with handling fights with little to no initiative and create a natural ebb-and-flow to combat, combatants are ["paired off"](#pairing-off) into **Engagements**. These are the momentary pairs or small groups that naturally form in the middle of any chaotic fight, and allows us as the players to "zoom in" on little microcosms of fights with the camera, as it were, focusing on resolving pairing after pairing. 

> This can help with indicisive players where ready pairings can resolve their Actions first.

Engagements are resolved simultaneously in-story and in-reality the order of Engagements doesnât matter, as with only 1 Action per turn melees do not effect each other.

#### Pairing Off
The rules of pairing off.

How do you avoid a long conga-line chain of awkwardly connected characters fighting someone who isn't fighting them? "**Pairing off**". 

Sometimes if you want to attack Mr A, even if they're attacking Mr B, because Mr C is attacking you and is otherwise unengaged, you have no choice but to be pulled from your initial intended target, who is said to "**Pull**" you, where you "**Pair Off**" with them. In other words, you cannot be "pulled" if you are "paired off": engaged with someone who is engaged with you.

Intent:

> Mr C -> You -> Mr A -> Mr B -> ...

Result:

> Mr C <-> You | Mr A <-> Mr B ...

âPullingâ, if in conflict, is resolve with an Initiative Contest. I've never had to use this rule, which shows how rare this situation is.

#### Maximum Engagement
A character can only be engaged by a maximum number of characters according to their relative Size. Sometimes someone is surrounded by attackers, and even if you wanted to join in on the bullying, you're crowded out. The maximum number of opponents a character of a given relative size can have is:
- 2+ sizes smaller - 1
- smaller - 2
- same - 4
- larger - 8
- 2+ sizes larger - any

### Resolving a Round
All combat is resolved in three simple steps:

1. **Determine Engagements** - (if this step is necessary) where combatents pair off. This may seem complex at the outset, but these rules mostly only exist to resolve edge-cases and opinions of conflict. 9 times out of 10 the GM simply needs to ask "OK, so who's fighting the Ogre wacking Gary and who's shooting back at the goblins?".
2. **Resolve Engagements** - resolving pairs/groups in a sensible/cinematic sequence. Melee conflicts are easily resolved in their engagements. Ranged attacks naturally involve unpaired individuals and so can be simply resolved. Determine any conflicts of interest with an Initiative Contest: such as "I cast Hold Person on him! Does he still hit me with his mace?" - roll initiative to see if the hold person went off in time.
3. **Resolve Movement** - finally, resolve any ongoing movement.

### Mounted Combat
Fighting on the back of a mount, such as a horse, flying carpet or dune worm, is tricky for the untrained. 

When mounted: 
- You suffer from the 'Unstable' condition. 
- You gain the benefit of +5ft of reach, if your mount is a size larger than you
- When your mount uses its Action to Move, it automatically moves you (and is not slowed, such as when grappled characters move). Since Movement happens last, any actions from the back of a mount occur before it moves apart from a 'Combined Charge' (see below).

It takes an Action to Mount or Dismount a mount. If you are knocked from your mount, you fall Prone. If your mount is two sizes larger than you, or more, the GM should consider fall damage.

**Combined Charge** - You and your mount both use your Actions. The mount Moves towards a target that is within its movement. At the end of that movement, the rider can make one Weapon Attack at Advantage against that target. If the mount cannot reach the target with a straight-ish movement, you cannot use Combined Charge.

## Combat Statistics

### Focus
Focus is a resource used by fighters taking certain Tactical Actions and is an exclusionary partner of the Concentration condition. 

Characters start with their Willpower of Focus (to a minimum of 1). Each point of Focus can be expended on certain Tactical Actions or to boost an initiative contest roll by d6, and you regain all used Focus on a Short Rest. This gives all characters a small (by default) pool of special moves they can pull off during a fight. 

There are Powers to boost your Focus pool, provide more Focus recovery and make new Tactical Actions available.

Focus and Concentration are "exclusionary partners" becase when you are Concentrating on a spell, you use cannot use Focus. If you must use Focus, you break Concentration.

### Health
Your Health maximum is:

> your Size's Base Health (+ any racial Health Bonuses or - any Health Maluses your character may have) + your Fortitude + your Willpower. 

It represents both your body's physical capability to take damage, and your mind's ability to soldier on while under assault. You reduce your current Health by any damage taken during play, and restore it through recovery.

Unlike other level-based TTRPG's, it does not increase unless specifically empowered through the `Health Increase` Power or other. Health is naturally limited and only those who invest in it become the ineffible heroes who seem to be able to take punch after punch where others would fall to the first blow no matter how many fights they'd been in.

### Defence
The Defence Stat is a dynamic value made of three* parts:
- a Base Defence value that keys off of Size, 8 for Medium characters. See the [Size Table](/trinitas/character-creation#secondary-statistics) on character creation for details.
- an Armour bonus from your worn Armour (see [Armour](./pedd/combat#armour)) and other sources
- a Stat bonus, which is by default your Reflexes (which can be limited / ignored by worn Equipment). Some Powers, like `Foresighted Defence` change which Stat/s are used.

The Block Action increases your Defence for a Round, and is an important tool in any character's repertoire.

There are two special scenarios that use a more limited form of Defence:
- **Stationary Defence** - Defence without the benefit of Reflexes. Some effects target Stationary Defence directly, and Surprised, Stunned and Immobilised targets only get their Stationary Defence. Any character whose Speed is 0, such as one suffering the Immobilised condition, uses its Stationary Defence. Powers that change the Stat bonus will note if the Stat can be used in Stationary Defence.
- **Unarmoured Defence** - Defence without the benefit of Armour, though armour limits on Reflexes are still applied (if appropriate). A few effects target Unarmoured Defence, notably Armour Piercing Weapons.

#### Natural Armour
Many creatures have Natural Armour, and so might you through unusual Powers and strange spells. Natural Armour grants an armour bonus, cannot be doffed and never limits Reflexes. 

Like other body armour, it does not stack, so to benefit from greater armour values, you must wear armour with a greater value than your natural armour.

#### Cover*
Cover is a sort of "fourth part" of defence.

Cover is a bonus to your Base Defence, a +2 for 'Half Cover' and a +5 for 'Three Quarters Cover'. This is independent of an Armour bonus or Stat bonus. 

For example: 

> a Medium character (8 Base Defence) wearing leather armour (1 Defence) with 3 Reflexes and in Half Cover (+2) has a Defence value of 14 (8+1+3+2)

Additionally, Cover bonuses apply to Reflex Saves.

## Damage, Dying, Wounds and Recovery

### Damage
After an Attack or other damaging Action occurs to a character, they take the final value calculated away from their Health. Once their Health runs out (reaches 0), that character is rendered Unconscious and Dying.

Health is regained through Recovery, see below.

### Dying and Death Saves
When you reach 0 Health, you enter the "Dying" state. You collapse Unconscious, a kind of Condition, and cannot take Actions. Additionally, you gain a rank of the Wounded condition.

Entering the Dying state is cumulatively dangerous, as the rank of the Wounded condition determines the chances of your character's Death Saves, and the chance to suffer permanent damage.

**Dying** - your Health is 0, you are Unconscious and you can take no Actions. Each Round you make a Death Save. At 3 failed saves, you die. At 3 success, you stabilise and the condition is removed (leaving you Unconscious).

**Death Saves** - when you are Dying you make Death Saves. The DC is the rank of the Wounded condition your character has multiplied by 5. So at Wounded I, Death Saves are made against a DC of 5, at Wounded II a DC of 10, Wounded III at DC 15 etc.

The more you're knocked down, the more likely you are to stay down, forever.

#### Wounded and Wounds
**Wounded [Rank]** - When your Health is reduced to 0 and you don't already have the Wounded condition, you go Unconscious and you gain the Wounded 1 condition. Each time you go Unconscious from your Health dropping to 0, your Wounded condition increases by 1. 

Wounds are severe physical and mental damage that threatens your continued existence. Each time you suffer the Wounded condition, make a Fortitude save vs a DC of the Wounded condition rank Ã 5. If you fail, roll on the wounds table below:

Table WIP - I'm going to balance the numbers with feedback

| d20 | Wound |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Dramatic Death** - you've taken a sudden and lethal wound, but fate has given you one last chance. At the end of the Round, you have one extra Action. |
| 2 | **Lose the left eye** - your left eye is irreparably damaged. Any Perception checks that rely on sight are at Disadvantage. If you have lost your right eye as well, you are permanently Blinded. |
| 3 | **Lose the right eye** - your right eye is irreparably damaged. Any Perception checks that rely on sight are at Disadvantage. If you have lost your left eye as well, you are permanently Blinded. |
| 4 | **Lose the tongue** - your mouth is badly damaged and your tongue cut loose. You cannot speak (you can still yell or make noise), and cannot cast spells with the Verbal component. |
| 5 | **Lose the nose** - your nose is irreparably damaged. Any Perception checks that rely on smell automatically fail. |
| 6 | **Lose the left ear** - your left ear is cut off. Any Perception checks that rely on hearing are at Disadvantage. If you have lost your right ear as well, you are permanently Deafened. |
| 7 | **Lose the right ear** - your left ear is cut off. Any Perception checks that rely on hearing are at Disadvantage. If you have lost your right ear as well, you are permanently Deafened. |
| 10 | **Facial Disfigurement** - your face is visibly damaged making others instinctively flinch. Any Charismachecks that rely on looks are at Disadvantage. |
| 11 | **Lose the left arm** - your left arm is missing from above the elbow. You cannot hold more than one item or weapon. If you have lost your right arm as well, you cannot hold any items and cannot cast spells with a Somatic component. |
| 12 | **Lose the right arm** - your right arm is missing from above the elbow. You cannot hold more than one item or weapon. If you have lost your left arm as well, you cannot hold any items and cannot cast spells with a Somatic component. |
| 13-15 | **Chest wound** - you take a chest wound, an internal injury. You take a permanent level of exhaustion that cannot be recovered. You can suffer this injury repeatedly. |
| 16 | left leg - -5ft movement. Permamnet Slowed if both. |
| 17 | right leg - -5ft movement. Permamnet Slowed if both. |
| 18-19 | heavy scarring - tight and painful scars criss cross large sections of your body. The GM has a Disadvantage token each session to spend on you, when your scars flare up and make a task harder. |
| 20 | **Light Scarring** - you gain a score of scars that should heal to leave an intimidating visage. You have Advantage on Intimidation when you put your scars to use. |

The Wounded condition loses one rank per Long Rest, and one rank per successful Medicine check made against a DC of the Wounded condition rank Ã 5 (the same as a Death Save). This Medicine check can be made once per day on a wounded character, regardless of success or failure, or who administers it.

### Wounds and Major Enemies
Enemy characters function just like player characters in that they have health and defence, but certain powerful enemies, for reference purposes known as "Major Enemies", can even suffer the "Wounded" condition: a simple twist that changes what it is like to play against them.

Most smaller enemy characters die immediately (or are otherwise defeated) when they reach 0 Health, not having access to Death Saves. Some important humanoid NPCs may go on to have Death Saves. Some power NPC's don't. They can take multiple "Wounds", and may lose parts of themselves (such as a tail, layer of armour, claws, part of their construction...), and will act differently, have access (or greater access) to certain powers etc.

A character with Wounds, when their Health reaches 0, instead lose one Wound and their Health resets to full. Meaning, each wound they can take is effectively an additional health pool. Such enemies, great monsters and infamous villains, must have their wounds be burnt through first, with every tier presenting a different kind of foe and challenge.

### Rests, Sleep and Downtime
During an adventuring day, your characters will tire and need a moment to catch their breath, as represented by the many Powers and systems that have a number of uses "per Short / Long Rest".

- **Short Rests** are 1 hour periods of Light Activity and / or Sleep.
- **Long Rests** are 8 reasonably-continuous hour periods of Light Activity and / or Sleep.

All Long Rests count as Short Rests.

**Light Activity** includes reading, talking, eating, or any other activity that needs little concentration. Generally, if a Check is needed, it is not Light Activity, including crafting, keeping watch or other professional activity.

**Sleep** - for those that can, every Character must Sleep for at least 8 reasonably-continuous hours every 24 hour period, unless some Power or racial feature says otherwise (such as Elves, who cannot sleep). Failure to sleep at all for 24 hours means you gain a point of Exhaustion. One does not need to sleep to undergo rest, although sleep counts as rest. 

#### Keeping Watch
Reasonably-continuous is a term specifically meant to allow characters to take Watch rotations of up to 2 hours each, where they can indeed make Checks for keeping watch as normal (if required), without breaking the 8 hours of a long rest.

#### Downtime
Trinitas has a third level of resting, Downtime, which is a 24 hour+ period of non-adventuring activity. As Short Rests are part of Long Rests, Long Rests are part of a Downtime, though many other activities can be gotten up to during Downtime. 

Downtimes are when character are free to train, pursue professions, craft, carouse, gather material, gather intelligence, manage business and any other Downtime Activity you can think of. 

### Recovery
When Resting, you recover your Fortitude as a flat amount to your current Health, up to your maximum Health. You regain Health one Short Rest per Long Rest (and every Long Rest). Meaning, per day, you can at maximum regain 2 Ã your Race's Baseline Health, unless your ability to recover is further empowered of course.

If you seek professional medical attention or magical healing, you may yet recover a lot more Health in a day. Few will be capable of fully recoving in a single day, not at least without a significant expenditure of resources.

**Full Recovery** - If you undergo a Downtime, or due to other exceptional circumstance the GM may decide, you gain a Full Recovery, where your character loses all ongoing conditions and maluses, and recovers all Health.

### Conditions
Other than straight damage, characters can suffer the effects of a **Condition**, some (typically ongoing) negative affect. 

Every condition, when inflicted, will state a duration (1 Round, 1 hour etc.). If a Condition is inflicted that Round, if necessary, roll Initiative to see if the condition applies before or after the target's Actions.

*Exhaustion* does not have a duration in-so-far-as any applied level of Exhaustion always requires a Long Rest to remove, so its duration is in affect "until the next Long Rest", and then of course only reducing the effect by 1 level.

As a short hand, Stunned is just Incapacitated for 1 round, so that obviously doesn't require a duration statement, and it is implied that Incapacitated occurs for more than 1 Round.

- **Blinded / Deafened** - A blinded / deafened character canât see / hear and automatically fails any check that requires sight / hearing, respectively. If your Attacks rely on this sense, they are made at Disadvantage.
- **Bleeding (Damage)** - A character takes the damage in brackets at the end of each Round until they use an appropriate Action to staunch the bleeding (such as using bandages). Non-living characters and others that don't bleed are immune to this condition.
- **Bloodied** - A fan favourite, when enemy characters fall below half health, they enter the "Bloodied" condition. This is purely an descriptive marker though this also often means their behaviour, tactics and even powers may change, becoming more aggressive and desparate. The Bloodied Condition also lets Players know that the target is below half Health. Alternatively, on monsters that have 2 to 3 Wounds, its the condition after 1 Wound.
- **Charmed** - unless otherwise stated, a charmed character considers you an ally and will heed your commands, which you can give freely, to the best of its ability. However it will not obey commands that are against its interests. If it is an intelligent character, you can attempt to persuade or otherwise convince them to obey, or that their interests lie elsewhere. For example, a charmed character will not attack another they consider an Ally, but depending on the situation, they may be persuaded to no longer consider the other character an ally.
- **Concentrating** - when you are using your Concentration on a Spell to maintain its effect. If you take damage, you must make a Willpower save vs the damage (to a minimum of 10) to maintain concentration, otherwise the Spell ends. If you are Concentrating, you cannot use Focus.
- *Dazed* - The target's Concentration, if any, is broken, and the next attack roll next Round it makes is made with Disadvantage.
- **Exhaustion** - exhaustion applies in "levels". 1 level is recovered after a Long Rest. At the 6th level, you die.
  - The target character suffers a -2 per level of Exhaustion penalty to all checks.
  - The target character suffers a -2 per level of Exhaustion penalty to their maximum Health.
  - The target character suffers a 5ft per level of Exhaustion penalty to their Speed.
- **Flanked** - when you are the one in an Engagement who the foe isnât Engaging, you have Advantage on your weapon attack rolls. You cannot flank a character 2 or more sizes larger than you.
- **Frightened** - A Frightened character has Disadvantage on Ability checks and Attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. If it chooses to Move, the character must move away, or otherwise out of line of sight, from the source of its fear. The character doesnât have to move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.
- **Immobilised** - the target character cannot take the Move Action. Additionally, the target must use its Stationary Defence.
- **Incapacitated**
  - The target character is Immobilised.
  - The target character cannot take Actions or Bonus Actions.
  - The target character has Disadvantage on Reflex saves.
  - Attack rolls against the target character have Advantage.
- **Pained** - the target character must succeed on a Concentration check to do any Action.
- **Prone**
  - A prone character's Speed is at 1/4
  - A prone character can use the Stand Bonus Action to end the condition.
  - A prone character has Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons that do not have the Prone Fighting property.
  - An attack roll against the prone character has Advantage if the attacker is within reach. Otherwise, the attack roll has Disadvantage.
- **Restrained** - the target character is Immobilised and Attack rolls against them have Advantage, and the target character's attack rolls have Disadvantage.
- **Poisoned** - A poisoned character has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. (Kinda lame)
- **Sluggish** - the target character can take an Action OR a Bonus Action, not both.
- **Stunned** - the target character is Incapacitated for the Round.
- **Unconscious**
  - The target character is Incapacitated, canât speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
  - The target character drops whatever itâs holding and falls Prone.
  - The target character automatically fails Reflex saving throws.
  - Attack rolls against the target character have Advantage.
- **Unstable** - When Unstable, such as being on a mount or standing in an earthquake, you have Disadvantage on Ranged Attacks and cannot attack beyond normal range.

### Environmental Damage
The following enviromental damage rules are updated and rolled into Conditions of the corresponding name:
- **Burning (damage, DC)** - A character burns for the amount of fire damage noted in brackets alongside the condition if they fail the save that causes the condition (also noted in brackets), and at the end of each following Round after failing the same DC again. If the save is made, no burning damage is taken. If no damage is listed, the default is 1d6. If no DC is listed, it is a DC 8 Fortitude save. Burning caused by a spell uses the mage's Magic Save statistic for the DC. They can take an Action to extinguish themselves.
- **Falling** - At the end of a fall, a character takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10ft it fell, to a maximum of 200ft for 20d6. The character lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.
- **Suffocating*** - A character can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Fortitude (to a minimum of 1). At the start of the next turn, it drops to 0 health and is dying, and it canât regain health or be stabilized until it can breathe again. If it recovers from Dying with a natural 20 and is still Suffocating, it suffers the condition anew as if just running out of breath again.

*Holding breath rules: A character can hold their breath for 1 minute plus their Willpower x 30 seconds (to a minimum of 30 seconds). When a character takes damage, they lose 30 seconds of breath. When a character runs out of breath they're Suffocating.

### Damage Types
Damage in Trinitas is defined as physical, organic, energy or mystical. Of each of these, it is further specified into types of damage that characters will encounter in their adventures. Each type also has an associated condition that they may also suffer, or inflict, when dealing with large or intense amounts of it.

Your GM liberally apply these affects, making damage do more than just Health numbers in many scenarios. Not every instance of each damage type should apply (indeed, the three weapon damage types apply on crits), but it creates good opportunities for complications for the GM to apply.
