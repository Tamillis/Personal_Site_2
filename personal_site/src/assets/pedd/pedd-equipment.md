a.	The X in Ammunition X refers to the number of times the weapon can be fired before needing to be reloaded. No value means one shot per reload.

b.	A flammable object hit by this ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.

c.	The Fire Lance also has the properties of a lance, for normal use. The firing of a fire lance can only occur once, then must be reloaded outside of combat after 1 minute's work and appropriate materials.

d.	Grenades and Firebombs effect an area, as such instead of attack rolls effected creatures make a dexterity save vs a DC of 8 + the thrower’s dexterity modifier + the thrower’s proficiency bonus. On a successful save the target takes half damage from grenades and firebombs or does not suffer the effects of the flashbomb.

**Blowgun** - Ammunition for this weapon is made up of small, fine needles that are especially potent when paired with a poison coating. When applying poison to ammunition for this weapon (blowgun needles), it can cover 10 pieces of ammunition instead of the usual 3.

**Cestus** - The weapon is not held in the hand, instead being wrapped around the wrist, held between the fingers, or covering the knuckles. Wielding this weapon does not prevent you from grappling or shoving an enemy, using an item, or interacting with an object, but you cannot wield other weapons with that hand.

**Garotte Wire** - Garrote Wire can only be used on a character the same size or smaller than the user, when the user has advantage against that character. On a hit the target is automatically grappled. Until the grapple ends, the target cannot breath and begins to Suffocate, if they can, and Garotte Wire attacks against the target automatically hit.

**Lance** - You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. A lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

**Net** - A character hit by a Net of its size or one larger is Immobilised until it is freed. A Net has no effect on characters that are formless, or
creatures that are two sizes or more larger than it. A character can use an Action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another character within its reach from a Net on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (Defence 10) destroys the Net and frees the character without harming it.

**Shiv** - Crude and simply made, a shiv is the weapon of the desparate. If you make an attack roll with this weapon and the dice result is 1, the Shiv breaks.

**Whip** - The whip functionally also has the benefits of the Winged property, without being Winged. 

#### Melee Weapon Properties

- **Ammunition (X/Y)** - You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have Ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a weapon). Expended arrows, bolts and darts can be recovered, by taking a minute to search the battlefield, but guns that use paper cartridges cannot. X denotes the short range of the weapon, and Y the long range (attacks at Disadvantage).
- **Armour Piercing** & **Light Armour Piercing** – the weapon ignores some benefit of Armour to a target's Defence. The target's Armour is reduced, to a minimum of 0, by 2 for Light Armour Piercing and by 6 for Armour Piercing.
- **Bleeds** - critical hits with this weapon when doing Slashing damage inflict gaping wounds and profuse bleeding, inflicting additional slashing damage equal to your Bonus. Non-living character types are immune to this damage.
- **Block** - You can raise this weapon like a shield, using your Bonus Action to Block, gaining a bonus of 1 to Defence.
- **Dazes** - critical hits with this weapon when doing Bludgeoning damage hit with a singularly boneshaking blow, dazing the target. The target's next attack roll is made with Disadvantage.
- **Ensnaring** - When you hit an attack with an ensnaring weapon, you may use your Bonus Action to attempt the Grapple action on the target or Shove them or make them Prone, using your weapon attack modifier in place of Strength. If you grapple a target with an ensnaring weapon, the grapple is automatically ended if you make another attack roll with that weapon.
- **Finesse** - The weapon lends itself to dexterous combat due to features that make it more reliant on technique than brute force. When attacking with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your
Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Finisher** - Finisher weapons are well-suited to executing enemies that are at your mercy. When you make an attack against a Prone or Incapacitated character, you roll one additional damage die.
- **Heavy** - These weapons are larger and unwieldier than most, lending them unique advantages and challenges:
  - Small characters make attacks with heavy weapons at Disadvantage.
  - A heavy weapon allows you to make an attack relying upon on raw strength instead of technique. When you attack with a heavy weapon that you're proficient in, you can forego adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add that proficiency bonus to the damage roll instead. You must decide to do this before making the attack roll.
- **Light** - A light weapon is small and easy to handle. When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a Bonus Action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your Stat to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. 
- **Loading** & **Slow Loading** - due to the elaborate procedure of preparing the weapon for its next shot, it takes an Attack, Action or Bonus Action to reload, and a free hand. Slow Loading weapons take an Attack or Action to reload.
- **Nonlethal** - The weapon is designed to incapacitate or is otherwise capable of delivering a hit that does not kill the target. Non-lethal Strikes can be made with normal damage rolls.
- **Parry** - The weapon has some weapon catching or deflecting feature, allowing it to be used to take the Riposte or Parry Actions.
- **Penetrates** - Critical hits with this weapon when doing Piercing damage sink deep into the tissue and tear at soft innards. The target must make a Fortitude save vs the attack roll or suffer a point of Exhaustion.
- **Prone Fighting** - When you are prone and make a melee attack with this weapon, you do not suffer Disadvantage for being prone.
- **Reach** - This weapon's extended length adds 5 ft to your Reach when you attack with it.
- **Sweeping** - These weapons strike in broad, sweeping motions. When you make an attack with a sweeping weapon that deals slashing damage, you may use a Bonus Action to deal the weapon's damage die in damage against a second target within your reach that is adjacent to the first, provided that your attack roll would also hit that target.
- **Versatile** - This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property–the damage when the weapon is used with two hands.
- **Wind-up** - The weapon can be used to spend time preparing an attack to be even more effective. On your turn you can use an attack or Bonus Action to swing up or set your weapon. On the next attack you make that Round with the weapon you can add an additional weapon die to that attack if it hits. A weapon can only add one such damage die in this way.
- **Winged** - These weapons have specially-shaped heads that halt the movement of their target toward the user and can also be used to catch shields and weapons. When you deal piercing damage against a character one size larger than you, or less, with a winged weapon, that character cannot move toward you that Round. Additionally can use the Disarm action with this weapon, using your Proficiency with the weapon's skill.

#### Ranged and Special Weapon Properties
- **Cartridge Loading** – due to the elaborate procedure of preparing a muzzle loading gun for its next shot, it takes an attack or an action to reload firearms, and a free hand.
- **Knockdown (Str)** – effected characters have to pass a Fortitude check vs the value given, or the passive strength of the User, or be knocked prone.
- **Knockback (Str/X)** – effected characters have to pass a Fortitude check vs the value given or be thrown X ft and made prone. Additionally, they take falling damage as if they fell X feet (regardless of the distance actually thrown).
- **Misfire** - on an attack roll of 1, the gun misfires; the attack fails, and a clearing bonus action to clean the gun is required before it can be fired again, leaving it unloaded.
- **Scatter X** – weapons with this property also target any Character within 5ft of the target, using the same to hit roll, for the damage indicated in X. The scatter property is not in effect if the primary target is 10ft or less from the attacker.

### Runes WIP
Runes come in many names, symbols, dragon-marks, elven characters and hieroglyphs, to name a few. Rune Magic is the domain of learning and using them.

Each Rune represents a concept of magic made manifest, and though any normal person would feel the runes slipping from their memory the second they look away, those capable of taking in their higher existence and commiting even that to memory, can imbue runes and make use of their magical powers. Each Rune is associated with a Spell, which that Rune can be used to cast, and a magical benefit from infusing the rune into items and clothing the rune mage bears.

The runes (discovered so far) are:

Rune | Name | Spell | Benefit
--- | --- | --- | ---
雲 | Cloud | Fog Cloud | You can control the presence or absence of clouds within a 1 mile radius and you can see through 60ft of obscuration.
死 | Death | Inflict Wounds | As a Bonus Action, you can add +1 to any physical damage done this Round. The bearer looks palid.
竜 | Dragon | Chromatic Orb | proficiency in Intimidation  and Language (Draconic)
敵 | Enemy | Disguise self | proficiency in disguise and you can alter small details about yoursel, such as eye colour, at will.
火 | Fire | Burning hands | immune to the cold, prestidigitation and produce flame minor effects
友 | Friend | Speak with animals | proficiency in persuasion and charm.
霜 | Frost | Armor of Agathys | immune to heat. Freeze water, preserve food etc a la presti
坂 | Hill | Goodberry | you have advantage on Exhaustion checks and saves.
旅 | Journey | Longstrider | speed increases by 5ft and your travel speed by 800 yards.
王 | King | Command | others assume you’re a higher station than them. You have proficiency in Willpower saves.
山 | Mountain | Entangle | you have proficiency in Athletics and Thrown.
力 | Power | * | Your Strength increases by 1, and your maximum Strength is 6. *Unlike other Runes, this Rune's "Spell" is the ability to cast any other worn Rune at one Magnitude higher than normal.
石 | Stone | Sanctuary | you always know in what direction and what distance (to the nearest 5ft) this symbol is from you. You have proficiency in Navigation.
嵐 | Storm | Thunderwave | you crackle with static and can cast Shocking Grasp.
