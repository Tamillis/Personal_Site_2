## A remake of 5e

"One D&D", sorry "5.5" now, is coming and Wizards of the Coast really put their PR foot in it with the licensing changes so we're all ready to jump ship. I instead find myself remaking the ship, taking what I think works well, and changing, exchanging and adding in what I would like it to have. So if I were to make a 6th edition of a fashion that suited my tastes and allowed me to explore, reformulate and refine areas of mechanics in which I personally have an interest, while keeping much the rest the same, this would be that. A sort of 5.75 if you will, or a "Pete's Edition of Dungeons & Dragons", you might say.

In addition to mechanics that I personally find interesting, a lot of the changes I've made are minor tweaks I've done over the years for new player friendliness. Many times now, I've found myself the DM for a group of newbies who I've coaxed into the hobby or given at last an outlet for their pent-up interest, and these changes better enable newer folks to enjoy the hobby without needing to work their way past legacy systems and jargon. While some changes will add complexity, many are done with new players in mind as well, and all of PEDD is written with the understanding that totally new-to-D&D-and-RPG's players will have to deal with them.

Taking the content of the Fifth Edition Player's Handbook as a base (meaning, assume normal 5e D&D unless otherwise stated), PEDD applies changes in three major categories: 
- a rework of the character creation system and core ability scores known as *Character Creation* 
- abolishment of the class and levelling system (including updates to nearly all features, feats and spells) known as *Power Progression*
- and a rework of the action economy and combat to increase table-engagement, speed up & simplify the work of combat and yet also enable it to be more tactical, known as *Combat*

Anything not mentioned is not changed as while this is a total homebrew makeover affecting vast swathes of the game, the base is still D&D 5e and you know what, that’s OK. It's a good base, and one we are all familiar with and that does a damn fine job, and by extending it, it means there's no need to repeat good material. It's all already there, and all already comfortable for us to continue to play with.

Note that all in-game terms as defined in PEDD are capitalised, like 'Action', and that a corresponding entry in the Index (WIP) can be quickly found, but not necessarily all capitalised words are in-game terms. If I get the implementation going, each term's index entry will be quickly visible via pop-up.

### Miscellaneous Changes
Changes to D&D 5e that don't fit in one of the three major categories above.

### Skills & Proficiency
Another part of PEDD is the flattening of the odd little distinct yet related categories of "Skills, Tools, Languages and Weapon & Armor Proficiencies". They all are now "Skills" in which you have "Proficiency", or not, meaning you get your Bonus to the roll. Most of the time anyone can attempt the actions that would be governed by a skill even if they're not Proficient, with the DM occasionally asking for "Trained" characters only to make a roll, meaning only those with Proficiency in the skill.

Weapons have also been regrouped into "Martial Skills", with redefined "Simple" and "Martial" weapons, where you no longer earn Proficiency per individual weapon or for the sweeping groups of "Simple" and "Martial", but instead in each "Weapon Skill". The old system was too fine-grained as well as bizarrely too broad as most gained weapon proficiencies through the massive sets "Simple" and "Martial" via their classes, and then a few odd weapons here and there.

**Body**, representing proficiency with unarmed combat, has been introduced as a Simple Weapon Skill, to remove Unarmed Combat from its odd state of limbo. 

Yes, due to being promoted to a Stat, Perception is no longer a Skill.

In PEDD no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, the alternate rule many of us run with anyway, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. Due to the shake-up in stats, some of the suggestions are not what they were in 5e. However if played well, you can Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use the Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: **Strength** for Melee, **Accuracy** for Ranged. If the weapon has the property "Finesse" you can instead use Dexterity for the attacks.

For reference, the Skills (and their recommended Stat, required for Martial), with <sup>M</sup> for Martial and <sup>K</sup> for Knowledge (see below), are:

#### Knowledge and Martial Skills
There are two kinds of specialist skills.
- **Knowledge Skills** - skills which most of the time you *cannot* attempt the actions that would be governed by this skill unless Proficient. You either know something, or you do not.
- **Martial Skills** - skills with weapons, armour and shields. Unlike other skills, some Martial Skills are marked with an *, meaning they require other Martial Skills before they can be taken. If a Background or Power provide Proficiency in such a skill before you have the requirement, you "Downgrade" it to the required Skill instead.
  - Heavy Armour requires Medium Armour which requires Light Armour. 
  - Battle-Axes and Mauls require Clubs & Axes.
  - Heavy Blades requires Blades which requires Knives.
  - Pole-Arms requires Spears

#### Simple Weapons
Simple Weapons are those that have no requirements:

</div>

#### Bonuses, Proficiency and Expertise
**Proficiency a.k.a. Bonus** - having Proficiency allows you to apply your "Bonus" to a skill check, irrespective to any Bonus gained due to the details of a Power or a circumstantial bonus the GM decides to bestow. This replaces 5e 'Proficiency bonus'. Every Proficiency is a Bonus, but not all Bonuses are from Proficiencies, to be clear. Except in exceptional circumstances the GM and the table feel are valid, you don't gain more than 1 Bonus to a roll at a time.

A special Power, “Aptitude”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3, then +4 and finally +5.

**Expertise** - Abilities with Bonus can gain Expertise to be grant effectively a double Bonus. Every area of the game that grants Expertise should only do so when that area already has a Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 with Expertise).

### Characters, Creatures and Monsters
Instances of 'creature' are updated to 'character' as generally the game is character focused and the clearer language helps. All monsters, beasts etc. do count as characters in this instance. However there is also a greater, clearer, emphasis on so-called 'monster types' as well, and are referenced in certain Powers. They're the (slightly expanded and rejigged) following categories known as Character Types:

#### Character Types
- **Aberrations** - so-called 'true outsiders', enigmatic and horrifying beings from beyond the outer planes and the boundary of Time and Space itself, sometimes referred to as the 'Far Planes'
- **Beasts** - natural creatures of the material plane, though humanoids and other sophonts are excluded from this category.
- **Celestials** - beings of the Good planes
- **Constructs** - beings of the plane of Logic and other constructs built in their image on the material plane
- **Dragons** - beings of ancient power and deep hunger, said to be all that's left of the three Creators
- **Demons** - beings of the plane of Passion
- **Elementals** - beings of the four ribbons of the elemntal braid, those old things from when the creators first wove the physical realms, or newer spirits of the lands, seas and skies.
- **Fell** - beings of the realm of Shadowfell, though sometimes erronously mixed with Fey or Undead.
- **Fey** - beings of the realm of the Fey Wild
- **Fiends** - beings of the Evil planes
- **Giants** - those who're descendants of the Titans, the first and greatest of the Creator's children.
- **Humanoids** - also known as Sophonts, those typically of two legs and two arms of the physical realms who're capable of intelligent thought. Further subdivided into the Races of the worlds (a very long list indeed; dragonborn, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblinoid, half-elf, halfling, human, tuskman, etc. ...)
- **Jurors** - beings of the planes of Reason, though often erronously confused with Celestials
- **Lycanthropes** - humanoids infected with a shape-changing disease and predilection for violence and the hunger of the far planes
- **Monstrosities** - creatures and other things of the physical realms and beyond, or a mix thereof, that require some mana to live. Things that are not 'of nature'.
- **Oozes** - curious life forms bare worthy of the name, neither plant nor animal nor fungus.
- **Plants** - and although scholars protest, fungi belong to this group
- **Sprites** - beings of the plane of Chaos
- **Undead** - humanoid husks that're turned to evil means by the black breath of Exanima.

There are many subcategories that the Character Types can be grouped with:
- **Material creatures**: beasts, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Living creatures**: beasts, dragons, fell, fey, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Natural creatures**: beasts, elementals, giants, humanoids, oozes, plants
- **Dark creatures**: aberrations, demons, fiends, lycanthropes, monstrosities (debated), fell, undead.
- **Outsiders**: Aberrations, Celestials, Demons, Fiends, Jurors, Sprites
