### ~My 5e Overhaul~
~"One D&D", sorry "5.5" now, oh no wait its D&D 5e (2024), which I think is impresively an even worse name, has come. Let me start that again.~

~Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro really put their PR foot in it with the OGL licensing changes (that they have also back-pedalled on so, yay for backlash I suppose. I mean, I'm using the CC-BY so who am I to complain?) and we were all ready to jump ship. I, however, found myself remaking the ship, taking what I thought worked well, and changing, exchanging and adding in what I would like the game to have.~

~Eventually I found myself having slipped well down the slippery slope of the heartbreaker (I mean what is this but a "fix" for what I find "broken" about D&D, literally about D&D), and that my "5.75e" had become its own system entirely. An evolution with many of the same hallmarks and perhaps even a few vestigal pieces, of the 5e that birthed it. Such is tinkering, I suppose. Originally I'd asked myself, if I were to make a 6th edition of a fashion that suited my tastes and that allowed me to explore, reformulate and refine areas of mechanics in which I personally have an interest, while keeping as keeping as much as I could the same (oh how I failed on that front), this would be that. A "Pete's Edition of Dungeons & Dragons", you might say.~

~Frankly, by now, this is not an updated edition of D&D 5e, but a total overhaul or, in other words, just my own heroic fantasy roleplaying system with familiar spells and features lifted from 5e. But hey, here we are. Seeing as I keep getting more and more serious about this little side project, I've started (and please don't sue me on this front, I really have only just started) implementing the legal-use of the 5e SRD. That means that there are probably chunks of D&D 5e that I've lifted that are not strictly part of the SRD and so need to be re-imagined in order to be compliant. I'm getting there.~

~In addition to mechanics and gameplay that I personally find interesting, a lot of the changes I've made are minor tweaks I've done over the years for new player friendliness. Many times now, I've found myself the DM for a group of newbies who I've coaxed into the hobby or given at last an outlet for their pent-up interest, and these changes better enable newer folks to enjoy the hobby without needing to work their way past legacy systems and jargon. Or so I've found. While some changes do add complexity, all are done with new players in mind as well, and all of PEDD is written with that understanding. So apologies to veterans if it feels like I'm belabouring the point.~

### Introduction

Welcome to Trinitas.

### Example Archetypes

Basically, some pre-made PEDD character builds, designed to show off the system a bit.

### Core Changes to 5e
Taking the content of the Fifth Edition as a base, PEDD applies changes in these major categories:
- Stat Changes - a rework of the core manner in which characters are represented in the system, see below.
- [Character Creation](/PEDD/character-creation) - a rework of the character creation system. This is what ballooned the most, as I'm sure you can imagine, to basically lead me to my own core systems rather than an "edition" of D&D.
  - [Power Progression](/PEDD/powers) - character creation now focuses around Powers, and an abolishment of the class and levelling system (including updates to nearly all features, feats and spells) which was the initial impetus behind this whole project. Levels are gone, experience is a thing of the past and an emphasis on organic growth with "Powers in training" replace it.
- [Combat](/PEDD/combat) - a rework of the action economy and combat to increase table-engagement, speed up & simplify the work of combat and yet also enable it to be more tactical.
- [Equipment](/PEDD/equipment) - incorporating the best of "Weapons Remastered, Revised" whose author I cannot find, and my own setting's emphasis on gunpowder weapons, as well as alchemical items and my take on runes.
- [Skills](/PEDD/skills) - a condensation and rework of the skill & proficiency systems, with a particular overhaul of how weapons are used.
- [Magic](/PEDD/magic) - a rework of how spellcasting works, making each unique in their own way (not just different stats and spell lists), as well as condensing the class spell lists into "sphere" lists, one for each spellcasting type, and giving the schools more prominence and thought.

While this is now a complete overhaul of 5e, anything not mentioned is not changed from the 5e ruleset (namely, Game Mastering) as while vast swathes of the game have been affected, the bones are still D&D 5e and you know what, that’s OK. It's a good base, and one we are all familiar with and that does a damn fine job, and by extending it, it means there's no need for me to repeat good material. That said, I will in time turn this into a "complete" system, at least from the player's perspective.

Note that all in-game terms as defined in PEDD are capitalised, like 'Action', and that a corresponding entry in the Index (a WIP) can be quickly found, but not necessarily all capitalised words are in-game terms. If I get the implementation going, each term's index entry will be quickly visible via pop-up, automatic highlighting etc.

### Flat Maths
A large part of the rewrite focuses on getting the maths right for the sweeping changes being made. It does this by making the maths "flat". This makes it easier to predict and interpret, and aids with the level-less design. It also has the added benefit of making something that was dangerous, always dangerous. Flat Maths means nothing "falls off".

To aid in the calculation of the maths, the following assumptions are kept to:
- "*Peasants*" face an average DC of 10, act at +0/+3 (unskilled/skilled, unskilled being the norm), have 8 Defence (unarmoured and no bonuses) and have 6 Health.
- "*Adventurers*" face an average DC of 15, act at +2/+5 (unskilled/skilled, skilled being the norm), have 15 Defence (armoured and/or with decent reflexes), and have 14 Health (having Hardy I).*
- "*Heroes*" face an average DC of 18, act at +4/+8 (unskilled/skilled, nearly always skilled), with +12 in their focus due to Expertise, have 18 Defence (high armour and/or reflexes), and have 30 Health (having Hardy II+).*

*Note that the numbers here are slightly skewed high, as I'm assuming that characters will naturally specialise and specialists will nearly-always be the one to attempt their field. For example, the health and defence numbers are what I expect for front-line characters that are supposed to take hits.

#### Damage Scales
As such, all damage sources will be re-calibrated; various high-level spells and large monsters are brought down. Typically by simply reducing the dice size based on the scale of lethality.

Two scales are used to determine damage: the size and the damage.

Size | ft (approx.) | dice
--- | --- | ---
Small | < 5ft | d3* / d4
Medium | 5ft | d5* / d6
Large | 10ft | d10 / d12
Huge <sup>5e</sup> | 15ft | d15 (rolling a d20 and rerolling anything above 15) or d16 (i.e. 1d8 + 8 if a second dice is even)**
Gargantuan / Huge<sup>PEDD</sup> | 20ft | d20

*These dice can be just half the value of the common d6 and d10, but that'd be annoying to do all the time so I'll just upgrade them to d4 and d6 respectively.

**Obviously this is kind of ridiculous to actually play with but to be honest I leave it here mostly as a demonstrator. The keen eyed will note that the scales double as you go up, and the dice remain relatively clean with the platonic solids, if you skip 5e Huge. So I will. This indeed is the basis for me ignoring the old Huge size category (and also because it better fits with my sense of fantasy Huge for Huge to actually be 5e gargantuan, and PEDD's Gargantuan to just be off the scale, literally).

Damage | No. of dice
--- | ---
Low / Peasant | 1
Normal / Adventurous | 2
High / Heroic | 3
Lethal | 4
Destructive | 5+

The idea here is that of Flat-Maths, thereby, taking the face-value and value-spread of such abilities easier for newer players to read. Two sword strikes, a fireball, or a headshot (e.g. a critical) will drop most to 0 Health.

A knife attack then, is 1d4 damage (plus Stat), a small scale low damage attack according to the above scale.

A fireball (8d6, which averages to about 5d10), is a destructive large scale attack, which also works out. It does concentrate the damage more in that centre, but that's OK. It's a spell, let it be special.

These scales also give me a guideline with which to collapse spells. I've been uhming and ahing about collapsing the magnitudes of the spell system from I to IX to I to VI, with I to V following the above scales and VI being for wacky overpowered spells.

#### DC's
DC's are relatively unchanged, but again become more consistant and easier to read. In [Skills](./pedd/skills) it is stated that "the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15" (thoughthere are in fact a couple of caveats to this). Since the probability curve for throwing one dice, the d20, is flat, this allows me to calculate the following DC's for a 50-50 chance to succeed at a given check, to which I have given rank-style descriptors to help envision who ought to be at that ability:

| Difficulty Class (DC) | 50-50 Chance for the |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | Disabled |
| 8 | Impaired |
| 10 | Peasant |
| 15 | Adventurer |
| 18 | Professional |
| 22 | Hero |
| 25 | Legend |
| 30 | Demi-god <br/>(as no non-superhuman can reach above +15 on a D20) |
| 40 | Godlike <br/>(as a theoretical cap to even the most powerful beings,<br/>a bonus to a D20 of +30) |

You'll note that the numbers don't progress "cleanly" such as 5, 10, 15, 20... etc. That's because these numbers have been calculated rather than thrown out there as a target or rough guide. Hopefully as I test the system, I can adjust these numbers to reflect not just predictions, but empirical results.

### Stat Changes - Where's Wisdom?
The first thing in Character Creation you will notice are the changed Stats. The 6 stats of D&D are so iconic they've become ubiquitous, appearing in systems that frankly do not need them. This has highlighted their idiosynchrosies and pitfalls time and again, and changing these was something I just couldn't resist. I've griped about them to my friends often enough, they wouldn't be surprised by this change. This was also the beginning of the slide down the slippery slope to full overhaul.

PEDD's stats are (and their Raison D'Etre):
- **Accuracy** : the ranged weapon attack stat as well as a 'move with precision' stat. Core stats should reflect core interactions, and ranged attacks (especially in my fire-arms based settings) are one of those. It is also a way to break up Dexterity, which has long been known to be over-tuned.
- **Perception** : as the most used skill and a core interaction, and something that ought to represent a facet of a character, it ought to be a stat too. It replaces the "sensing" aspect of Wisdom as well.
- **Strength** : unchanged, but includes most situations Constitution would be used actively (such as with endurance. <small>Yes I know explosive strength and endurance strength are physically very different things but the system doesn't need such a distinction</small>)
- **Dexterity** : re-focused as the stat used in feats of adroitness and physical skill. In game terms it becomes the "skill stat" as its primary area of concern.
- **Charisma** : unchanged but includes Wisdom's old domain of empathy and human-relations.
- **Intelligence** : unchanged, but also determines number of skills.

These 6 stats are combined to make the 3 Resistances, since saves are still a thing and a line is drawn between reactive (saves) and active (stats):
- **Reflexes** (Accuracy + Perception) : one's ability to avoid danger with accurate movements and seeing attacks coming. This also means Dexterity is not used in Defence calculations (by default).
- **Fortitude** (Strength + Dexterity) : one's ability to power through bodily harms from the combination of the power and capability of their body. Replaces Constitution.
- **Willpower** (Charisma + Intelligence) : one's ability to overcome mental hardship, through both aspects of their mentality.

A better and more in-depth explanation can be found in [PEDD Character Creation](/PEDD/character-creation#Statistics).

Generally speaking wisdom has been removed, with all of the D&D weirdness about 'connection' and 'perception' being part of wisdom, even though most people use wisdom like willpower, and it just generally having a very poorly defined and understood area of concern confusing veterans and newbies alike for decades. It gets especially odd when many people's definitions of wisdom start to sound a lot like Intelligence, such as having the wherewithal to notice something isn't real but is in fact an illusion. Which the game itself calls an Intelligence save!

To address these issues, I've split wisdom in twain. Willpower is willpower, everyone gets that. The coverage of wisdom over connections, in terms of human relations and empathy, is now under Charisma, and perception is under the new Stat Perception (which also handily stops Perception being the most-important-adventuring-skill). Connection to divine power is covered by Faith, a secretive seventh Stat for those to whom it matters, and to primal power via the unrelated-to-the-character Verdance table.

This does leave the window open for those hankering for a sense of “wise”, as in an individual who has a broad body of experience to call upon and errs on the side of patience. Characters still have the various Knowledge skills, and there is now the "Learned" Power for wisdom in the sense of being broadly knowledgeable, educated, well-read, etc., and the “Wisened” background that is wisdom in the sense of a wide body of practiced wisdom coming from age and life experience; the non-academic sage. It is also, I find, mostly simply a matter of role-play. Stop me if you have heard of a high-wisdom character who's player hasn't been capable of acting wisely?

### Retrospectives on PEDD
Having played a recent game for a group of newbies I've noticed that there is *still* a lot of up-front work even with the presentation of cards for easy pick-and-mix character creation.

The main issue was with the presentation and determination of stats, which makes me want to simplify them. In retrospect, I've ended up with a system of 11 Stats! 15 (!) if you count Health, Defence, Speed and Initiative, which in a way my players did. They're all just terms given the same amount of attention to them. Which, to be fair, is a bit mental. If you get really gnarly, you can add Armour and Base Defence in there too.

As such I've removed all non-stat increases from the racial options (so resistances are purely derived), I've axed initiative (to be determined by Dex / Per depending on the context pre-fight / whatever the roll-off should be dictated by). Defence complexity is intended so that's staying, though player's are encouraged to note their typical 'Defence', when armoured and not flat-foot. Base Health, Speed and Size are unchanged but de-emphasised, now tacked on to race as really that's all they are anyway. Evasion was given its own name to help diffentiate it from Reflexes as a shorthand for "reflexes value capped by armour and a minimum of 0" but that sort of just didn't work with new folks oddly enough. I'll try using just Reflexes next and see if that works out better. At the very least in needs to be de-emphasised.

On an unrelated note, one way to communicate the ideas behind the Primary Stats are the following schema of worldy-interaction: 
| - | Brute Force | Subtle | Reactive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **External** | Acc. | Per. | Ref. |
| **Surface** | Str. | Dex. | Fort. |
| **Internal** | Cha. | Int. | Will. |

This helps delineate between the potentially confusing Dexterity and Accuracy, Dexterity and Reflexes, and Strength and Fortitude. 

Strength and Dexterity can be seen as two very different ways to physically interact with the environment: brute force and subtlety: flow and redirection. 

## Miscellaneous Changes
Changes to D&D 5e that don't fit in one of the major categories above. As PEDD has grown, this section has shrunk as what was here, has now become their own sections.

### Metric 'Conversions' and other Term Clarifications
Certain measures consistently crop up so for reference here's what they would roughly be in metric:
30ft - 10 metres
5ft - 2 metres
10 gallons - 40 litres

Also, 1 Round is 6 seconds, give or take some dramatic leeway.

Power / Spell use of the words "Character" and "Target". A character is any humanoid or other type of creature. A target includes objects or particular points in space, basically anything. I'm in the process of rewording things to clearly match this definition, so use common sense if what the power / spell currently says doesn't make sense.

### N/A Statistics
I think I've written elsewhere but I can't find it now. A stat value of N/A, which only happens for NPCs, means that it is meaningless for that character to have a value for that stat. This is relatively common for Intelligence and various non-sophont characters. Any skill check that is called for using that stat automatically fails, as does any save. It may be the case that the check or save is instead done with a different stat, or entirely nullified by the GM. Many mind affecting spells don't have any affect on unintelligent creatures, for example.

### Characters, Creatures and Monsters
Instances of 'creature' are updated to 'character' as generally the game is character focused and the clearer language helps. All monsters, beasts etc. do count as characters in this instance. However there is also a greater, clearer, emphasis on so-called 'monster types' as well, and are referenced in certain Powers. They're the (slightly expanded and rejigged) following categories known as Character Types:

#### Character Types
- **Aberrations** - so-called 'true outsiders', enigmatic and horrifying beings from beyond the outer planes and the boundary of Time and Space itself, sometimes referred to as the 'Far Planes'
- **Beasts** - natural creatures of the material plane, though humanoids and other sophonts are excluded from this category.
- **Celestials** - beings of the Good planes
- **Constructs** - beings of the plane of Logic 
  - **Machines** - other constructs built by the hands of mortals in the image of divine logic or otherwise, on the material plane. This means there are "Outsider Constructs" and "Material Machines". That only Constructs seem capable of sentience, no matter how clever the Machine, is a matter of some theology.
- **Dragons** - beings of ancient power and deep hunger, said to be all that's left of the three Creators
- **Demons** - beings of the plane of Passion
- **Elementals** - beings of the four ribbons of the elemntal braid, those old things from when the creators first wove the physical realms, or newer spirits of the lands, seas and skies.
- **Fell** - beings of the realm of Shadowfell, though sometimes erronously mixed with Fey or Undead.
- **Fey** - beings of the realm of the Fey Wild
- **Fiends** - beings of the Evil planes
- **Giants** - those who're descendants of the Titans, the first and greatest of the Creator's children.
- **Humanoids** - also known as Sophonts, those typically of two legs and two arms of the physical realms who're capable of intelligent thought. Further subdivided into the Races of the worlds (a very long list indeed; dragonborn, dwarf, elf, gnome, goblinoid, half-elf, halfling, human, tuskman, etc. ...). Scholars argue that this should in-fact be two categories: humans and little-people.
- **Jurors** - beings of the planes of Reason, though often erronously confused with Celestials
- **Monstrosities** - creatures and other things of the physical realms and beyond, or a mix thereof, that require some mana to live. Things that are not 'of nature'.
  - **Lycanthropes** - regular humanoids or beasts who become monstrosities under specific conditions, typically having been infected with a shape-changing disease or placed under a corrupting curse.
- **Oozes** - curious life forms barely worthy of the name, neither plant nor animal nor fungus.
- **Plants** - and although scholars protest, fungi belong to this group
- **Sprites** - beings of the plane of Chaos
- **Undead** - natural, humanoid and legendary husks that're turned to evil means by the black breath of Exanima.

Certain Character Types are grouped into "Creatures" for the purposes of identification with certain Spells and Powers.
- **Outsiders**: aberrations, celestials, constructs, demons, fiends, jurors and sprites
- **Unnatural Creatures**: elementals, fell, fey, machines, monstrosities and undead
- **Natural Creatures**: beasts, oozes and plants (funghi are 'plants')
- **Legendary Creatures**: dragons, giants
- **Humanoids**: All the playable races, humans, little-people, beast-folk and the "monsterous races" who, at the end of the day, depend simply on who you ask.

There are many other classifications and subcategories that the Character Types can be grouped with or described by in-world:
- **Material creatures**: beasts, constructs, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, machines, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Living creatures**: beasts, dragons, fell, fey, giants, humanoids, lycanthropes, monstrosities, oozes, plants
- **Light creatures**: celestials, fey, jurors, and constructs
- **Dark creatures**: aberrations, demons, fiends, lycanthropes, monstrosities (debated), fell, undead.
- **Magical creatures**: aberrations, dragons, elementals, giants, fell, fey, monstrosities and (if one counts as made-of magic, rather than bearing-magic) undead

## Converting from 5e

### Features
First, any and all Features can be taken as written so long as any areas of the game they touch haven't been effected by changes in PEDD. Those that do will need adjusting, and some Features have been rewritten wholesale, such as Spellcasting (which has its own section in Magic [here](/pedd/magic#spheres-of-magic)). See the points below.

**Ability Score Increases** - any "Ability Score Increase" features are constrained to, at maximum, two +1's in the stated abilities. Any base-race - subrace combinations with 3 or more ability score increases only increase 2 Stats by +1, and you can choose which two. Any increases to Dexterity can instead be increases to Accuracy. Any increases to wisdom are instead increases to your choice of Perception or Willpower.

**Perception Proficiency** - any feature that gives proficiency in perception instead grants the Keen Sense Power.

**Saving Throw Proficiency** - any feature that gives a saving throw proficiency instead gives +1 to the corresponding Resistance

### Spells and Flat Math Damage Rescaling
Number of dice based on size, x1 for small/medium, x2 for large, x3 for huge, x4 for gargantuan.

Size of dice based on intended damage, 1 for pittance, d4 for non-lethal, d6 for serious (50/50 on killing a Health 4 peasant...), d8 for lethal, d10 for highly lethal, d12 for massive damage.

### Converting Saves
Whenever 5e asks for a save of a certain kind, using the following conversion:
- Strength Saves -> Fortitude Saves
- Dexterity Saves -> Reflex Saves / Fortitude Saves*
- Constitution Saves -> Fortitude Saves
- Intelligence Saves -> Willpower Saves
- Wisdom Saves -> Willpower Saves / Reflex Saves**
- Charisma Saves -> Willpower Saves

*Dexterity is somewhat redefined as the agility and capability of one's body irrespective of their physical Strength or Accuracy. Pure dodging, then, (as most old Dexterity saves were) are covered by Reflex saves, however those old Dexterity saves that were more about the capability of the victim's body (such as jumping high enough) would now be covered by Fortitude saves, which represent more one's physical ability to mitigate damage. 

**Wisdom, is an odd one. See ["Where's Wisdom?"](#wheres-wisdom) for my thoughts on that. By default use Willpower, but if Perception would be more appropriate, use a Reflex Save instead.

### Converting Races
Races have been tweaked in a number of ways. Go through the following steps to convert a Race:

1. Use the original Age, Size and Speed. Add a description for the race in the Materium Existentiae.
2. Adjust the Attribute Increase feature to reflect the pattern: ["A Stat +2", "Another Stat +1", "A third Stat -1"]. Adjust using other races as examples if necessary. Combine sub-races if necessary.
3. Add Senses, this may include darkvision if it is a required part of the fantasy of the race. Note that Low-light vision is back, so that might be more appropriate (like Elves, Gnomes, Dragonborn etc.).
4. Introduce Baseline Health (default: 6 base, -1 for small, +1 for large, -1 for weak, +1 for strong)
5. Remove any Skill proficiencies not distinctly tied to the physicality of the race (such as weapon or tool proficiencies)
6. Remove all other non-iconic features and make them the Racial Powers options for that Race, including from all sub-races.
7. If a Racial Power is iconic (it cannot be removed without intrinsically damaging the fantasy of the race), keep it as a named feature of the race. (Such as Lucky, for the Halfling). Try to balance power through tempering racial powers for that race, or introduce a malus elsewhere (such as lowering baseHealth, like I have for the Elves)
8. Create a list of Racial Powers from the removed Features, converting each Feature to a Power, and include any other racial powers to that list that should apply (check with your GM).

### Converting Spells

Spells are mostly left as is, but the use of Flat Math means that damage does need to be brought down for higher level spells. As I haven't started to do that yet, I don't have a baseline to recommend here.

Another are that needs redoing are Reaction spells. By default, change Reaction to Bonus Action. It may make sense to rejig the effect slightly as well, such as "until the start/end of their next turn" to "this turn" since that's how that works now.
