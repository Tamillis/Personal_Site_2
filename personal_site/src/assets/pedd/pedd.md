## A remake of 5e

"One D&D" is coming and Wizards of the Coast really put their PR foot in it with the licensing changes so we're all ready to jump ship. I instead find myself remaking the ship, taking what I think works well, and changing, exchanging and adding in what I would like it to have. So if I were to make a radical 5.5e of a fashion that suited my tastes and allowed me to explore, reformulate and refine areas of mechanics in which I personally have an interest, while keeping much the rest the same, this would be that. 

In addition to mechanics that I personally find interesting, a lot of the changes I've made are minor tweaks I've done over the years for new player friendliness. Many times now, I've found myself the DM for a group of newbies who I've coaxed into the hobby or given at last an outlet for their pent-up interest, and these changes better enable newer folks to enjoy the hobby without needing to work their way past legacy systems and jargon. While some changes will add complexity, many are done with this in mind, and all of PEDD is written with the understanding that totally new-to-D&D-and-RPG's players will have to deal with them.

Taking the content of the Fifth Edition Player's Handbook as a base (meaning, assume normal 5e D&D unless otherwise stated), PEDD applies changes in three major categories: 
- a rework of the character creation system and core ability scores known as *Character Creation 5.P* 
- abolishment of the class and levelling system (including updates to nearly all features, feats and spells) known as *Power Progression*
- and a rework of the action economy and combat to increase table-engagement, speed up & simplify the work of combat and yet also enable it to be more tactical, known as *Combat 5.P*

Anything not mentioned is not changed as while this is a total homebrew makeover the base is still D&D 5e and you know what, thatâ€™s OK. It's a good base, and one we are all familiar with and that does a damn fine job, and by extending it, it means there's no need to repeat good material. It's all already there.

Note that all in-game terms as defined in PEDD are capitalised, like 'Action', and that a corresponding entry in the Index (WIP) can be quickly found, but not necessarily all capitalised words are in-game terms. If I get the implementation going, each term's index entry will be quickly visible via pop-up.
