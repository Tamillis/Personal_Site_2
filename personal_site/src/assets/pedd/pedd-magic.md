## Spheres of Magic
Spellcasting has undergone a serious remake. Gone are spell casting classes, of course, and spell lists for each class, and even the confusingly labelled 'spell-levels'. Now all spell lists are combined into 4 “Spheres of Magic”; Arcane, Divine, Primal and Occult. The schizophrenic "Spellcasting" feature has been separated into 5 different spellcasting Powers, one for each Sphere as well as one for Pact Magic. Each are fundamentally unique Powers that operate on their own principles, adding both flavour and mechanical differentiation.

Note that there is significant overlap for the spheres, many spells belong to, and are usable by, more than one sphere.

### Spells and Converting Spells to PEDD
By and large Spells have been kept as-is, with the rather large caveat that Flat Math needs to be applied to them, and the subtler changes that the One Action All At Once Combat system requires. Here are some guidelines for converting spells.

- Reaction -> Action

### Mana Magnitude and Reserve
Spell levels and spell slots have received a semantic rework as can be seen in the 'Mana' Power, as the spell-level and spell-slot naming conventions were old and counter-intertuitive. Countless times I've had new players get confused about levels, spell levels and how spell slots work. Now admittedly with the removal of classes and character levels, I could have left spell levels in without ambiguity, but I didn't as apparently I'm anethema to levels. Spell levels are relabelled to "Magnitude" and spell slots to "Reserve". A spellcaster has "X Reserve of Y Magnitude", with one spell using one use of a Magnitude of Reserve. "Upcasting" is shorthand for casting a spell at a certain Magnitude using a higher Magnitude Reserve if that's all you have left.

### Innate Spells, and Prepared Spells & Sources
Another semantic rework is "Prepared" spellcasting and spellcasting with "Known spells". Now there are explicit Innate and Prepared Spells depending on the kinds of spellcasting Powers available to a character. "Innate spells" are learned spells memorised or made reflexive by the caster: they never need to be prepared. All Cantrips, for example, are Innate (and also take 0 Reserve to cast). Prepared spells then, to Spheres that can, allow a spell caster to Prepare a spell they don't otherwise have ready for use. The manner and method a spell is Prepared depends on the Sphere, but it means the caster can choose from any Spell they have access to in their "**Source**":

- The Source of Arcane spells is the wizard’s spellbook, which they accrue over time by writing down Arcane Sphere spells they encounter and invent.
- The Source of Divine spells are that devotee's deity. This is a spell list which the deity, in all their wisdom and might, chooses for the day from all the Divine Sphere spells. Ultimately the DM, somewhat knowing the future with their preparation and who acts as the deity in question, produces a subset of the divine sphere which the character can then choose from. Alternatively the DM and player check whether the spell list the player wants for that day is OK by the Diety (the DM). It might be that, for a given day, a deity requires a character to prepare a particular spell, that certain spells on the Divine list are anethema to that Deity, or the Deity (the DM) feels a certain spell not on the Divine list ought to be (so it is).
- Primal spells can be sourced at any time from the entire Primal sphere of magic, but it is fundamentally limited in breadth and scope compared to the others so this seeming advantage still balances out.
- The Source of Occult spells are many, varied and esoteric, from the bloodline of a sorcerer to the pact of a warlock to the power of storytelling itself.

### The Arcane Sphere
Arcane magic practitioners, commonly called wizards, are your typical learned mage. They collect a large repertoire of Prepared spells in their iconic item: the Spellbook. Through intense study they can memorise the immense complexities of a select few spells in their book each day, preparing as they think they will need from their reportoire on a day per day basis. Famously, wizards are known to invent spells [choosing any spell from the Arcane Sphere or working with the GM to craft custom spells] as a down-time activity.

Arcane magic is used through the Arcane Spellcasting Power, which is centered around the Spellbook and the filling of that book with Spells by copying or creating them. That section of the Power is repeated here for reference:

**Spellbook** - You have a spellbook containing six 1st-Magnitude arcane spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the spells you know, except your Innate spells, which are fixed in your mind. You can add to your spellbook through two methods: spell invention or by copying spells you encounter in your adventures. Spell invention is a Downtime Activity, where you 'invent' a spell of your choice from the Arcane Sphere spell list.

**Replacing the Book** - You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own studies and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

**The Book's Appearance** - Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

**Spell Copying** - copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the intricacies of the spell into a form your mind can replicate in magic. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds and/or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each Magnitude of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Any spell scrolls, spell books or willing teachers you encounter in your adventures can let you copy spells into your spellbook.

**Spell Invention** - enclosed in study, wizards perform experiments, decipher and combine criptic hints from fragmented scrolls and coax into existance entirely new spells. For each Magnitude of the Spell to be invented, the process takes 1 down time and 25gp. It can be any spell from the Arcane Sphere.

You can only invent and copy spells that you have the mana Magnitude for.

### The Divine Sphere
 > Spell list - Cleric, Paladin

Divine Magic is that which is bestowed upon loyal followers by divine beings and auspicious fates. Divine spell casters can have innate spells, their so-called "domain" spells, and prepared spells. Uniquely, Divine spells are cast using an entirely separate statistic: Faith, which becomes a new Stat for characters with access to the Divine Sphere. 

When a character takes any Power that gives them access to Divine spells, they must add the Faith Stat to their character sheet. They must also note to which deity or cause their Faith belongs, and therefore have a rough idea of what it means to be faithful to that cause, to uphold its virtues and abhor its vices. It starts at +2, but due to character actions, with player collaboration, the DM can choose to increase or decrease the Stat, typically by 1 in either direction during monumental actions that go for or against the faith. It is expected for Faith to change once every 2-6 sessions.

### The Primal Sphere
> Spell list - Druid, Ranger

Primal Magic is driven by the user's connection to the power of nature, wherever it is they find themselves. At the end of each Long Rest the caster must, in addition to preparing spells, commune with nature to be empowered by the 'Verdance' of the current locale. Consult the Verdance table below, also found in the "Primal Spellcasting" Power, and your DM to calculate the Verdance you use for your Primal Spells in the coming day, as well as any Powers that modify the Verdance you can access.

#### Verdance Table
| Verdance | Boreal | Coastal | Deserts | Forests | Jungles | Plains | Mountains | Swamps | Underground |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barren   | -1 | 1 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 |
| Poor     | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Middling | 1 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Rich     | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Abundant | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 |

The Primal Mage can freely choose from the entire Primal Sphere when preparing spells, limited as it is. Life is consistent in its tenacity, so is life magic. Limited in scope but steady in power, caring little for the whims of the individual, but implaccable in its march.

### The Occult Sphere
> Spell list - Bard, Sorcerer & Warlock

Occult magic is that which refutes study, bends logic and breaks minds. Those that practice it rarely chose to do so, or came to use it through a myriad of unorthodox ways. Such spells are always Innate; esoteric knowledge carved into the mind and body of the Sorcerer. It is not prepared, or one might say it is prepared into their very souls. 

Occult spellcasting uses Fortitude, Reflexes or Willpower, halved and rounded up (so a +5 Willpower is a +3 Spell Casting Modifier etc.), to cast spells: depending on the spell's school, as they rely on their being to conjure the magic. 
- **Fortitude** - Abjuration, Conjuration and Enchantment
- **Reflexes** - Illusion, Transmutation
- **Willpower** - Divination, Evocation, Necromancy

### Pact Magic
Pact Magic, while clearly occult in nature, functions quite differently to other spellcasting Powers, as fundamentally the magic is derived from some other powerful individual known as a *Patron* who entrusts power into their vassal, who merely channels that power. Not all who have a Patron are provided with magic, as the character might not have the Pact Magic Power, but one needs a Patron with whom to make a pact in order to access the magics that come as part of that pact.

Patrons are known to plug their warlocks with all sorts of spells of varied yet thematic spells, with each Patron presenting a unique spell list: one of the sphere's as a base plus a number of "emblematic spells" added to that list, and "anethema spells" that may be removed. Patrons are also known to change what spells they imbibe their followers with during periods of communion, and so Pact Magic is the only kind known to change spells during a Downtime Activity period, rather than a Rest or not at all as is the case with Innate Spells.

As in the base game, Pact Magic is also notable for its vastly different spellcasting resource. It avoids the need for Mana. Instead, the warlock has a well of power that is known as their “Stipend”, that “Recharges” after a Short Rest, unlike other Spellcasting which uses Mana Reserve that returns on a Long Rest.

Lastly, the Spellcasting Ability that governs the magic casting is also dictated by the Patron.

Pact Magic does not count as one of the 'Spellcasting' Powers for the purpose of the 'spellcasting' prerequisite of some Powers (which is why it doesn't have that tag).

### Spell Schools
Spell schools are another vestigial part of the D&D system, but I think they're actually quite interesting and deserve a bit more love. Now many Powers key specifically off a spell's school, notably Occult Spellcasting and my Goblinoid's race, hopefully making them more interesting and useful!

#### Spell-like and Spellcasting Powers
Many Powers grant "spellcasting", where the character learns spells and through Mana or the details of the Power, can cast them at certain Magnitudes. Some Powers grant "spell-like" abilities where the effect of the Power is the same as the state spell, but the character does *not* know the spell outright, meaning that if they gain Mana they still cannot "cast" the spell, as it were. Spell-like Powers can be thought of as independent access to the spell, or even physical and mental abilities that bring about coincidentally the same effect. After all, it is said many scholars craft spells to mimic supernatural phenomena and abilities of powerful creatures.
