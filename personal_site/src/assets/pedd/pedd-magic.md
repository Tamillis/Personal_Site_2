## Magic
Trinitas has 4 Spellcasting Powers, Pact Magic and various Spell-granting Powers that give characters access to fantasy magic Spells which are special actions, pieces of magic, with a myriad of effects both active and passive. Magic is almost limitless in what it can do, as you can see in the range of [Spells](/trinitas/spells) adapted to the Trinitas system so far.

### Spheres of Magic and Spellcasting
Magic is split into 4 “Spheres of Magic”: Arcane, Divine, Primal and Occult which has an associated "Spellcasting" Power each.

Each are fundamentally unique Powers that operate on their own principles, adding both flavour and mechanical differentiation. Aspects of the spellcasting powers that are in common are repeated as magic rules here.

### Magic Statistic
All spellcasting Powers allow characters to cast magic. Which Stat you use for casting magic, your **Magic Statistic**, is noted in the spellcasting Power. This may be one of your other Stats, a function of them, or some external value such as Verdance for Primal magic.

Spell Attacks, like weapon attacks and other checks, use your Stat and your Bonus. You always gain your Bonus to Spell Attacks from Spellcasting.
> **Spell Attack** - your Magic Statistic + your Bonus

The Passive value of the Magic Statistic is used in determining the DC for your **Spell Saves**, also known as:
> **Magic Save** = 8 + your Magic Statistic + your Bonus

### Mana, Magnitude and Reserve
All spellcasting Powers also require the Mana power, which means the character has a well of mystical energy they can draw on to cast magic spells.

**Magnitude** - Mana comes in Magnitudes, up to 9 (I'm planning on dropping this to 5 / 6 and rewriting high and low-level spells to reflect this change, but that's WIP). Casting a spell at a certain magnitude determines the scale of its effect (if appropriate), and more powerful spells have a minimum magnitude greater than 1.

**Reserve** - According to the rank of the Mana power, you will have certain "Reserves" of Mana per magnitude. One cast of a spell uses up one Reserve.

**Casting Spells with Mana**. You use 1 Reserve of a Magnitude of Mana of your choice, that you have available, to cast 1 spell. The Magnitude must meet the minimum required by the spell. If you have run out of necessary Reserve (or higher, see Upcasting), you cannot cast that spell until your Mana replenishes.

**Upcasting** a spell is casting a spell at a higher than minimum Magnitude if that's all you have left, even if the spell denotes no scaling effect. The higher Magnitude Reserve is used up and the spell occurs as normal.

### Spell Details
Spells have components to show how they can be cast:

- **Verbal Components** - A spell that needs Verbal components must be spoken. A silenced mage cannot cast this spell.
- **Somati Components** - A spell that requires bodily gestures, through hands or similar apendages. A restrained mage cannot cast this spell.
- **Material Components** - A spell that requires physical catalysts. The items listed in the material component of the spell must be in the mage's hands to cast the spell. If the components are consumed, they are turned to dust (or similar) and are gone as part of the action (regardless of spell success), but otherwise materials are not consumed. Additionally, if a mage has access to a Focus, they can use the focus in lieu of any non-consumed materials.

**Spellcasting Focus** - this item, if the spellcasting power has one and the spellcaster possesses one, is used in lieu of any material components, unless those Material Components are consumed.

**Ritual Spells** are spells available to you that can be cast without spending Mana if cast for an extra 10 minutes in silent and stationary Concentration. In affect, anyone who knows or has prepared a ritual spell, can cast that spell as a ritual for "free" given the extra time and chance to do so. Ritual spells, if they require Material Components, still do when cast as a ritual.

**Cantrips** are small magics, often with a wide range of effects, that a mage has learned over the course of their studies. Their minor effects means that they take no Mana to cast, and are embedded in the mage's mind as Innate Spells.

**Innate Spells** - these are spells that are bestowed / memorised / reflexive and otherwise integral to the caster: they never need to be prepared. All Cantrips, for example, are Innate.

**Prepared Spells** - are those spells a caster chooses to make ready at the end of a Long Rest for use, until they have another Long Rest and choose their Prepared Spells again. If a spell is not Prepared or Innate (i.e. "unprepared"), it cannot be cast. Prepared Spells are chosen from a list as determined by the spellcasting Power.

### Spell Lists and Sources of Magic
All spellcasting Powers allow you to choose the spells you know Innately, or Prepare daily, from a "spell list" known as their **Source**. It depends on the sphere of magic and kind of spellcasting:

- The **Source of Arcane** spells is the reportoire kept in the wizard’s spellbook, which they accrue over time by writing down Arcane Sphere spells they encounter and invent.
- The **Source of Divine** spells are that devotee's deity or other righteous font. This is a spell list which the deity, in all their wisdom and might, chooses for the day from all the Divine Sphere spells. Ultimately the GM, somewhat knowing the future with their preparation and who acts as the deity in question, produces a subset of the divine sphere which the character can then choose from. Alternatively, the GM and player check whether the spell list the player wants for that day is OK by the diety. It might be that, for a given day, a deity requires a character to prepare a particular spell, that certain spells on the Divine list are anethema to that Deity, or the Deity feels a certain spell not on the Divine list ought to be (so it is).
- The **Source of Primal** spells is nature itself, meaning all primal spells can be prepared from for the entire Primal sphere of magic. Nature spells are fundamentally limited in breadth and scope compared to the others so this seeming advantage balances out.
- The **Source of Occult** spells are many, varied and esoteric, as is only expected. Their magic could be from the bloodline of a sorcerer to the pact of a warlock to the power of storytelling itself. Generally speaking, occult spellcasters have access to the entire occult sphere, but they're encourage to roleplay their spell choices, and GM's are encouraged to be a lot more loose with what spells any given occultist has access to, both adding to and taking away from their Source.

Each Spellcasting Power, and Pact Magic, denotes its source. Pact Magic is known, among certain circles, to be sourced from their patron who themselves can be of any of the spheres, and thus each practitioner can be expected to use wildly different magic to the other.

### Spellbooks
Arcane magic practitioners, commonly called wizards, are your typical learned mage. They collect a large repertoire of Prepared spells in their iconic item: the Spellbook. Through intense study they can memorise the immense complexities of a select few spells in their book each day, preparing as they think they will need from their reportoire on a day per day basis. Famously, wizards are known to copy and invent spells.

Arcane magic is used through the Arcane Spellcasting Power, which is centered around the Spellbook and the filling of that book with Spells by copying or creating them. That section of the Power is transcribed here for reference:

**Spellbook** - You have a spellbook containing six 1st-Magnitude arcane spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the spells you know, except your Innate spells, which are fixed in your mind. You can add to your spellbook through two methods: spell invention or by copying spells you encounter in your adventures. Spell invention is a Downtime Activity, where you 'invent' a spell of your choice from the Arcane Sphere spell list.

**Transcription** - copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the intricacies of the spell into a form your mind can replicate in magic. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds and/or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each Magnitude of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\nAny spell scrolls, spell books or willing teachers you encounter in your adventures can let you copy spells into your spellbook.

**Spell Invention** - enclosed in study, wizards perform experiments, decipher and combine criptic hints from fragmented scrolls and coax into existance entirely new spells. For each Magnitude of the Spell to be invented, the process takes 1 down time and 25gp. It can be any spell from the Arcane Sphere.

You can only invent and copy spells that you have the mana Magnitude for.

**Replacing the Book** - You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book. For example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own studies and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared in your mind into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

**The Book's Appearance** - Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

### The Divine Sphere
Divine Magic is that which is bestowed upon loyal followers by divine beings and auspicious fates. Divine spell casters can have innate spells, their so-called "domain" spells, and prepared spells. Uniquely, Divine spells are cast using an entirely separate statistic: Faith, which becomes a new Stat for characters with access to the Divine Sphere.

When a character takes any Power that gives them access to Divine spells, they must add the Faith Stat to their character sheet. They must also note to which deity or cause their Faith belongs, and therefore have a rough idea of what it means to be faithful to that cause, to uphold its virtues and abhor its vices. It starts at +2, but due to character actions, with player collaboration, the GM can choose to increase or decrease the Stat, typically by 1 in either direction during monumental actions that go for or against the faith. It is expected for Faith to change once every 2-6 sessions.

### The Primal Sphere
Primal Magic is driven by the user's connection to the power of nature, wherever it is they find themselves. At the end of each Long Rest the caster must, in addition to preparing spells, commune with nature to be empowered by the 'Verdance' of the current locale. Consult the Verdance table below, also found in the "Primal Spellcasting" Power, and your GM to calculate the Verdance you use for your Primal Spells in the coming day, as well as any Powers that modify the Verdance you can access.

#### Verdance Table
| Verdance | Boreal | Coastal | Deserts | Forests | Jungles | Plains | Mountains | Swamps | Underground |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barren   | -1 | 1 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -1 |
| Poor     | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Middling | 1 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Rich     | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Abundant | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 |

The Primal Mage can freely choose from the entire Primal Sphere when preparing spells, limited as it is. Life is consistent in its tenacity, so is life magic. Limited in scope but steady in power, caring little for the whims of the individual, but implaccable in its march.

### The Occult Sphere
Occult magic is that which refutes study, bends logic and breaks minds. Those that practice it rarely chose to do so, or came to use it through a myriad of unorthodox ways. Such spells are always Innate; esoteric knowledge carved into the mind and body of the Sorcerer. It is not prepared, or one might say it is prepared into their very souls.

Occult spellcasting uses Fortitude, Reflexes or Willpower, halved and rounded up (so a +5 Willpower is a +3 Spell Casting Modifier etc.), to cast spells: depending on the spell's school, as they rely on their being to conjure the magic.
- **Fortitude** - Abjuration, Conjuration and Enchantment
- **Reflexes** - Illusion, Transmutation
- **Willpower** - Divination, Evocation, Necromancy

### Pact Magic
Pact Magic, while clearly occult in nature, functions quite differently to other spellcasting Powers, as fundamentally the magic is derived from some other powerful individual known as a *Patron* who entrusts power into their vassal, who merely channels that power. Not all who have a Patron are provided with magic, as the character might not have the Pact Magic Power, but one needs a Patron with whom to make a pact in order to access the magics that come as part of that pact.

Patrons are known to plug their warlocks with all sorts of spells of varied yet thematic spells, with each Patron presenting a unique spell list: one of the sphere's as a base plus a number of "emblematic spells" added to that list, and "anethema spells" that may be removed. Patrons are also known to change what spells they imbibe their followers with during periods of communion, and so Pact Magic is the only kind known to change spells during a Downtime Activity period, rather than a Rest or not at all as is the case with Innate Spells.

As in the base game, Pact Magic is also notable for its vastly different spellcasting resource. It avoids the need for Mana. Instead, the warlock has a well of power that is known as their “Stipend”, that “Recharges” after a Short Rest, unlike other Spellcasting which uses Mana Reserve that returns on a Long Rest.

Lastly, the Spellcasting Ability that governs the magic casting is also dictated by the Patron.

Pact Magic does not count as one of the 'Spellcasting' Powers for the purpose of the 'spellcasting' prerequisite of some Powers (which is why it doesn't have that tag).

### Spell Schools
Spell schools are another vestigial part of the D&D system, but I think they're actually quite interesting and deserve a bit more love. Now many Powers key specifically off a spell's school, notably Occult Spellcasting and my Goblinoid's race, hopefully making them more interesting and useful! Magic, as it has been "put under the knife", keeps both the traditional spell school names, and modern names.

The spell schools have received some revision, and every Spell has been reclassified if necessary based on this understanding and a simple reading of the spell’s effects. If a different school is a better fit (to the schools as explored here) then it has been changed.

#### Abjuration – Barrier Magic
Setting up lines of separation in order to induce effects, typically by preventing or reducing something from crossing a line, such as fire. Sometimes seen as the higher order magic of Energy Magic, as its about manipulating energy states and (most importantly) preventing changes of energy, rather than the creation or elimination of it. It is the bread and butter of wards.

#### Conjuration – Summoning Magic
The drawing and creation of objects and creatures into the caster’s hands or vicinity from some other location temporarily, quickly returning to whence they came. Typically, this involves aligning the location with the desired elemental ribbon or the demi-plane of the desired abstract concept, such as acid or base, “summoning” material. This school also includes bridging distances within the same plane (what you and I may call teleportation), overlapping with Entropic Magic, though this is, counter-intuitively, much harder to do than bridging planes.

**Abeyance Magic** – The creation of temporary forms with pure mana is a well-known subschool. These temporary, entirely mana-based, objects quickly decay leaving nothing but fast-fading motes behind, as they are no true and lasting form.

#### Divination – Portent Magic
Magic that learns from or tries to nudge the future. Rumour has it that the most powerful seers can even manipulate past occurrences, or at least create effects that appear as if part occurrences were different. Some schools of thought split divination magic into that which reads the future, and that which manipulates it: Communications Magic and Fate Magic.

#### Enchantment – Mind Magic
The magic to make others think something else, through direct application of thoughts, modification of ethical values, or manipulations of understanding. Projecting sense information directly into a mind is traditionally lumped with Illusion as it is an "external" force on the mind, versus "internal" forces coaxed by enchantment.

#### Evocation – Energy Magic
Energy that is generated and directed to directly create a variety of effects, primarily attacks. This is perhaps the widest and basest of all the schools, as it covers the host of direct effects the weave can express, and crops up, at least partially, in every field of magical study and application. It is also simply what most peasants think magic *is*. No one domain has claim to it. Due to the nature of energy as having one of many potential forms, so often is Energy Magic split into the various fundamental forces; light, sound, force (movement, momentum, potential), heat, charge, magnetism, chemical bonds. Just add the word "Magic" after each.

#### Illusion – Phantom Magic
Illusions are fundementally separated in twain; Mind Magic that deceives the senses of its targets by creating fake input, and Energy Magic that creates plausible effects in the real world itself. The intense focus and specialisation needed to create detailed Illusions from these two schools is what created the Illusion school, the eponymous Phantom Magic, even if scholars would argue that Phantom Magic is nothing but a bad classification. The fractious Imagers and other practitioners of illusion know better, that their school is just as much a study as any other. Even if fundamentally little is original, it is a classic example of the differences between fundamental and applicable arcana.

#### Necromancy – Soul Magic
Technically necromancy is the manipulation of life force for effect, *any* effect which includes healing and the anchoring / reanchoring of a soul within a life force shell (a.k.a. resurrection) by manipulation of anima-exa. Necromancy and its poor reputation both at hearth-sides and in ecclesiastical circles comes more from the history of those who studied soul magic, and the manner in which they did so. Manipulating a soul is nearly never something one wants done voluntarily. But the recently deceased still have their anima-exa and souls, and do not argue, and so here begins the repupation of necromancers.

Anima-ipsa, the matter of the soul itself, and not just the life-force shell that anchors it in one's body, is irrevocable, even to magic, so in truth even the name “soul magic” is a bit of a misnomer. It is considered blasphemous by those called holy to mess with the Cycle of Thought, and evil to steal life force. To force a soul into black-anima is the blackest of magics.

**Haemomancy** - a sub-school of necromancy, particularly concerned with powering spell effects by sacrificing life force and anima-exa, typically in the form of blood from where the name is earned.

#### Consumption Magic
A rare and fringe school of magic that most who know of it reject – the ritual consumption of skin, flesh and bone of animal and plant matter in order to take on traits of the consumed by incorporating bits of their soul, temporarily or (more commonly) permanently, often resulting in drastic bodily changes. Practitioners call themselves 'Evolutionists' and often quote their tongue-in-cheek moto: "you are what you eat".

#### Transmutation – Form Magic
Magic that manipulates the aspects and forms of physical things, including life, into new and more useful forms by affecting the underlying Aristopoulian images, the “form”, of those objects and directly or indirectly editing that form. It is related to Summoning, but differentiated by the use of real forms (just the manipulation of them), and its ability to be far more lasting than any summoning, though only powerful magic can make permanent changes to a form. Aristopoulus [Son of Ariston, i.e. plato] was an ancient archmage who founded the school during the Age of Eden.

#### Entropic Magic
Due to its rarity and difficulty for mortal humanoids to wrap their linear minds around, a domain of magic as yet not enshrined in a school is Entropic Magic – the manipulation of time and space, creating fields and zones of alternate time (frozen, changed rate, unwinding) and alternate space (different relational properties, different dimensions, different causalities). The only field of Entropic magic with any level of understanding are Portals, and even then they are known for the difficulty and danger.

#### Spell-like and Spellcasting Powers
Many Powers grant "spellcasting", where the character learns spells and through Mana or the details of the Power, can cast them at certain Magnitudes. Some Powers grant "spell-like" abilities where the effect of the Power is the same as the state spell, but the character does *not* know the spell outright, meaning that if they gain Mana they still cannot "cast" the spell, as it were. Spell-like Powers can be thought of as independent access to the spell, or even physical and mental abilities that bring about coincidentally the same effect. After all, it is said many scholars craft spells to mimic supernatural phenomena and abilities of powerful creatures.
