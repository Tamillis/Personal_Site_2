## Character Creation
Trinitas is so named for the three pillars of a character: their race, their background and their role.

While making these choices, they'll also choose their character's Statistics (see [Core Rolls & Statistics](/trinitas/core-rolls)), [Skills](/trinitas/skills) and [Powers](/trinitas/powers).

As a step 0., players are asked to consider their [character concept](#character-concept) that they'll carry through character creation, guiding their choices which in tern refine their concept.

Step-By-Step Character creation in Trinitas looks like this:
0. *Create a Character Concept* - in a phrase, define the core of your character. Who is it that they *are*? What is it that they *do*?
1. *Choose a Race* - the circumstances of your being. Choose one Race, giving the following base statistics and features:
   1. Stat Changes - typically a +2, +1 and -1
   2. Secondary Stats - Size (giving base health and defence), Age, Size and Speed
   3. Racial Features - some races have inherent racial features common to them all - like inbuilt Powers
   4. Racial Powers - A pick of (typically) 2 of the Racial Powers available to that Race
   5. Your Upbringing - You also get 2 non-martial skills and one language of your choice - the childhood skills and native language that represent your upbringing
2. *Choose a Background* - the circumstances of your way of life before adventuring. They give the following:
   1. Stat Increases - +1 to 2 Stats
   2. 6 Skills - the skills of your background.
   3. Equipment - Some initial equipment you've kept from your background days
   4. Background Power - You're free to choose one power from the Background category that thematically matches your envisioned background, though one is suggested.
3. *Choose your Role* - the way that you adventure and tackle the world. You choose the following:
   1. Stat Increases - a +2 to a Stat of your choice, and a +1 to another Stat of your choice.
   2. Role Skills - 4 + a number of Skills equal to your Character's (now final) Intelligence of Skills. It's suggested to pick up some martial skills if you lack the ability to defend yourself at this stage.
   3. Role Powers - Your initial 3 adventuring Powers, chosen from any non-racial Power: one of which must be a `combat` Power, and one of which must be an `exploration` Power. 
   4. Adventuring Equipment - chose your Equipment from one of the collections; the equipment that you find yourself with just before the game begins.

### Character Concept
Before character creation proper I ask you, the players, to think of a core character concept: a fantasy person they would like to play, to inhabit and act out. It will form a basis you can build on instead of the trap of a race or class as the old way lent itself to be. (I've seen many, many newbies open an RPG book and then go "I want to be a Dwarf Ranger", or what have you. That's not a character, that's a video game avatar).

Of course, your concept will be a fluid thing, and is expected to change as you go through character creation and - choosing slightly different-to-expected options as you go - you refine the concept. 

Your Character Concept leads directly into your Role, so its best to make it a single evocative phrase or demonym that is the sum of what it is that you *do* as an adventurer.

For example:
 - The Heavy Metal Mage
 - Noble Rebel of the Czondazani Cause
 - An Ihleiskan Ex-Reaver
 - Outback ranger & his trusty yak
 - Priestess of the forgotten Ashen Gods
 - The Renowned Twin-sword Duelist of Tarentaise

At each of the following steps, (Race, Background and Role), you will have opportunities to think of your character's **Bonds**, **Ideals** and **Flaws**. But feel free to jot any now if your Concept already prompts some. Remember to lean on your Bonds, Ideals and Flaws (and your GM) to earn Inspiration.

### Races
Your race is what you were born as. The choices your character had no hand in making, which is why this step includes Upbringing. Consider not just the circumstances of your character's birth, your physical circumstances like your weight, your appearance, your family, where you called home and all these little factors.

Make a note of your place of birth and the formative events of your early and late childhood, creating Flaws (deep-rooted assumptions, traumas, rivals), Ideals (beliefs you were raised with) and Bonds (family, friends, childhood haunts) as appropriate.

Your Race also determines your Size, Speed, Age and, most impactfully, any **Racial Features** you may have.

Every Race has at least 1 "Any" stat change, so consider the selection in terms of how you were born, or formative events in your childhood.

[See Races here](/trinitas/races)

#### Racial Powers
In addition to the above, every Race grants 2 **Racial Powers**.

You choose 2, (3 for Half-Elves and Tuskmen, 1 for Dwarves), Racial Powers when you choose a Race. With these options not even two individuals of the same Race have the same capabilities, necessarily, and often hail from differing and distant heritages. All members of a race have the potential or leaning for the physical and mental attributes described by these Powers, but only those with the Power have that trait to a strong enough degree that it becomes relevant (and present as a Power in game-play terms).

You are welcome to choose more Racial Powers of your Race as part of normal progression if it makes sense at the table, as you unlock latent capabilities or overcome that which was holding you back etc.

#### Upbringing
Your 'upbringing' is the kind of childhood you had. You freely pick 2 non-martial Skills, representing your those you were taught, learned or had no choice but to pick up while growing up. Additionally you take the 'Languages (one)' Skill, noting that as your native language. By default in my games in the Materium Existentiae, your Childhood Language will be Imperial Common.

Note that even if you don't have the common language of the campaign you're playing, such as Imperial Common, you are still considered conversational in it. You just don't get Proficiency in any social interactions using it, and you're considered to have a noticable accent, poor grammar and narrow vocabulary. Generally, for other languages, if you're not proficient with it you cannot attempt to speak it.

### Backgrounds
Your background is the profession and/or way of life you pursued before taking on the mantle of 'Adventurer' and left it all behind, or were forced to. It emphasises skills, those you honed to a professional level, more than Powers, of which you gain only one. Make a note of the equipment, as this is a list of items they've carried with them into the world of adventuring. Historically you may have had much more, or less(!), to your name.

Your background and the Power they learned alongside it are your character's first true choices, and so may say a lot about their ideals and their flaws, or represent a significant bond of theirs. Make a note of these too.

[See Backgrounds here](/trinitas/backgrounds)

### Role
Your role is who you are as an adventurer. It is the means with which you adventure! Your Character Concept should evoke an idea of the kind of powers you'll need to realise it. Unlike class-based TTRPG's, Trinitas allows you total freedom to define and design your adventuring style, the "role" you hold within the party. Take this opportunity to channel your fantasy image, and also bear in mind any Flaws, Ideals and Bonds this role has come along with.

#### Role Powers
The main purpose of a Role is to embody what kind of Adventurer you are, and the Powers you choose to facilitate that are paramount. 

Choose any 3 non-racial Powers: one of which must be a `combat` Power, and one of which must be an `exploration` Power. Use the tags to help you. Your Role will only grow as you play, gaining more Powers.

[See Powers here](/trinitas/powers)

#### Role Skills
In addition to the skills granted by your race and background so-far, you also gain proficiency in a number of Skills equal to 4 + your Intelligence. You've gained skills across your entire life: through childhood and your background, so consider these Skills those you've learned and had to use as an adventuerer, in particular any martial skills you most likely are currently lacking in. These are the arms and armour of your Role, so be thematic.

You can pick any skills freely from [Skills](/trinitas/skills) section.

#### Equipment
Finally, the possessions you have on you at the start of your adventure. Take a note of the equipment you already have from your background, and then choose one collection of equipment that fits the image of your Role: [See Collections](/trinitas/equipment#equipment-collections)

**Starting Equipment** - All characters start their adventure with a set of travelling clothes, a Backpack (or equivilant, like a knapsack), an empty waterskin, 5 rations and a simple melee weapon of their choice.

See the Weapons and Armour sections for details about those items.
