## Character Creation 5.P

Step-By-Step Character creation in PEDD looks like this:
1. *Create a Character Concept* - in a phrase, define the core of your character.
2. *Determine Initial Statistics & Resistances* - the capabilities of your character's body and mind, assigning an even spread of initial values: -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2.
3. *Choose a Race* - the circumstances of your being. Choose one of the Race cards below, which gives the following base statistics and features:
   1. Stat (or Resistance) changes - typically a +2, +1 and -1 
   2. Base Health, Age, Size, Speed and Senses characteristics, and perhaps a few racial abilities
   3. A pick of 2 of the Racial Powers available to that Race
   4. You also get 2 general skills and one language of your choice - your childhood skills and native language.
4. *Choose a Background* - the circumstances of your way of life. All handbook backgrounds, and some more, are available as Background cards below. 
   1. Stat (or Resistance) Increases - typically +1 to 2 Stats
   2. 6 Trained Skills
   3. Initial equipment
   4. One "Background Power" you can freely chose from the list of Background Powers, with one suggested.
5. *Choose your Role* - the way that you adventure and tackle the world. You define your Role with a phrase and a vision, and this could be the same or similar to your Concept
   1.  Final Stat increases - +1 to a Stat and +1 to a Resistance of your choice
   2.  Final Skills - a number of Skills of your choice equal to your Character's final Intelligence
   3.  A set of 4 Martial Skills to equip your Character with.
   4.  Your initial 3 adventuring Powers (see [Powers Progression](https://bellaby.co.uk/pedd/pedd-powers)), chosen from any non-racial Power. 
6. *Finalize Equipment* - after Race, Background and Role all that is left is to chose your starting Equipment from one of the starting collections and a pack of your choice that you find yourself with just before the game begins. The use of equipment is identical to 5e.
7. *Come Together* - last but not least, you put everything together [just like the base game](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#6ComeTogether)

As you work your way through these steps, select or input your inputs. This document doubles as a character creator for PEDD!

### Character Concept
While not new, I ask players to think of a core character concept (a fantasy person they would like to play, to inhabit and act out) as the very first step of character creation, to form a basis they can build on and have the basis of their character be an idea, not a race or class as the old way lent itself to be (I've seen many, many newbies open the book and then go "I want to be a Dwarf Ranger", or what have you. That's not a character, that's a video game protagonist). Of course, this is a fluid thing, and is expected to change as you go through character creation and, choosing slightly different options as you go, you redefine your character's core concept. I expect players to be constantly updating their Core Concept based on their mechanical choices, but not for the mechanical choices to be the basis.

As they do, they can add to their **Bonds**, **Ideals** and **Flaws** as they go through each step, but again thinking of these as part of the first step of character creation.

#### Name
WIP - Enter your character's Name.
<div id="character-name"></div>

#### Concept
WIP - Enter your character's Concept
<div id="character-concept"></div>

#### Bonds, Ideals and Flaws
WIP - Enter your character's Bonds, Ideals and Flaws. At least 1 of each.
<div id="bonds-ideals-flaws"></div>

### Ability Statistics

The ability score into modifier system was vestigial so I removed it. All characters have "Ability Statistics", a.k.a. "Stats", a single value ranging from -3 to +5 for humanoid and player characters (higher and lower for monsters and "Super humans", with in-system values running from -5 to +10).

Stat Value | Meaning
--- | ---
-3 | Severely Handicapped - even menial tasks are difficult
-2 | Handicapped - most basic tasks are difficult
-1 | Below Average - you fail to overcome most challenges
0 | Average - unremarkable, equivalent to an unskilled labourer
1 | Capable - you're more capable than the unskilled
2 | Professional - you're trusted to succeed
3 | Exceptional - you're renowned within the region
4 | World-class - few in the nation can best you
5 | Legendary - your capability is on the level of the myths of the Gods

The base statistics of a character are [-2, -1, 0, 0, +1, +2]. Alternatively, dice rollers can roll 4d6, reducing each result by -4, and then roll another 4d6 reducing each result by -3. Record each value. Discard 2 dice so that the rolls add up to a value from 2 to -2, rerolling all 8 dice if you cannot.

Stats are primarily affected by your Race, and secondarily bumped up by your Background and your Role.

During character creation no Statistic can be increased beyond +4, unless explicitly stated. If a Race, Background or Role would raise a Stat above 4, instead you may raise a different Stat (again, not above 4).

#### Statistics and Resistances
A line is drawn between your active Statistics used for Actions, and your passive Resistances which are used to mitigate harms. Resistances are calculated values, from Statistics, Race and Background. They can be above 4 or below -3, they are whatever the calculation comes out as.

There are six **Statistics** (used in checks):
- **Strength** - used in melee attacks, and feats of brawn
- **Dexterity** - used in many skills, for feats of deftness
- **Accuracy** - used in ranged attacks, and feats of precision
- **Perception** - used to sense the world, spot hidden things, and read others
- **Intelligence** - used in knowledge and understanding, for feats of alacrity
- **Charisma** - used to affect others through force of personality, empathy and displays of emotion

If you get involved in matters of the divine, your Faith as a statistic becomes important, although other characters are also welcome to have and track their Faith (note, do not calculate Faith like other Statistics, instead see Divine Spellcasting):
- **Faith** - the attunment of your soul to the divine path of your deity / deities / philosophy.

And three **Resistances** (used in saves):
- **Fortitude** - the ability of the body to throw off and work-through ills. Calculated from **Strength** + **Dexterity**.
- **Reflexes** - the ability of the body and your awareness to avoid harms. Calculated from **Accuracy** + **Perception**.
- **Willpower** - the ability of the mind to resist. Calculated from **Intelligence** + **Charisma**.

#### Difficulty Class and Resistance DC's
A term I've carried over is "Difficulty Class", a.k.a. "DC", meaning the target number you must meet or beat to succeed a dice roll. Sometimes enemy attacks and other effects are made against your "Resistance DC", this is 8 + the Resistance value.

#### Stats
WIP - Assign your Stats. (Resistances and Resistance DC's calculated from Race and Background chosen below, Secondary Statistics can be found [here](#secondary-statistics))

<div id="stats"></div>

#### Converting Saves
Whenever 5e asks for a save of a certain kind, using the following conversion:
- Strength Saves -> Fortitude Saves
- Dexterity Saves -> Reflex Saves / Fortitude Saves*
- Constitution Saves -> Fortitude Saves
- Intelligence Saves -> Willpower Saves
- Wisdom Saves -> Willpower Saves / Reflex Saves**
- Charisma Saves -> Willpower Saves

*Dexterity is somewhat redefined as the agility and capability of one's body irrespective of their physical Strength or Accuracy. Pure dodging, then, (as most old Dexterity saves were) are covered by Reflex saves, however those old Dexterity saves that were more about the capability of the victim's body (such as jumping high enough) would now be covered by Fortitude saves, which represent more one's physical ability to mitigate damage. 

**Wisdom, being poorly understood by perhaps even the designers of 5e themselves, is an odd one. See ["Where's Wisdom?"](#wheres-wisdom) for my thoughts on that. By default use Willpower, but if Perception would be more appropriate, use a Reflex Save instead.

#### Secondary Statistics

- **Health** - how much damage you can take before entering the Dying state. Your Race provides your **Base Health** and your **Fortitude** + **Willpower** is added on top to determine your total Health. Health is explicitly a combination of physical and emotional wear and tear, and the ability to roll with and carry on from blows.
- **Defence** - how difficult you are to harm. **Base Defence** + **Armour** + **Evasion**
  - **Base Defence** - 8 for Medium characters and 10 for Small characters.
  - **Armour** - determined by the sum Defence of worn equipment.
  - **Evasion** - your **Reflex** value to a minimum of 0, can be modified by some Powers, can be limited by worn equipment.
- **Speed** - unchanged, determined by Race
- **Initiative** - **Perception** + **Dexterity** (+ a bonus from some Powers)
- **Passive Statistics** - sometimes Powers or play require a value to compare against. The DM can ask you to make a roll that then represents that value, and sometimes they will ask for your "Passive Strength" etc. This is 8 + the Stat Value.

#### Tertiary Statistics
These 'Statistics' are not used in the game explicitely, but are a fun little aside for calculating ancilliary values for your character. Feel free to skip this step if you're not interested, or completely ignore its results.

- **Appearance** - the comeliness of your visage, **Strength** + **Charisma**
- **Agility** - the speed and adroitness with which you move, **Dexterity** + **Accuracy**
- **Foresight** - your ability to predict how things will come out moment-to-moment, **Perception** + **Intelligence**

A few Powers and corners may use these Stats, but only explicitely as the combination of normal Stats that define them, such as with "Foresigthed Defence" which is built upon Perception and Intelligence.

#### Where's Wisdom?
Generally speaking wisdom has been removed, with all of the D&D weirdness about 'connection' and 'perception' being part of wisdom, even though most people use wisdom like willpower, and it just generally having a very poorly defined and understood area of concern. It gets especially odd when many people's definitions of wisdom start to sound a lot like Intelligence, such as having the wherewithal to notice something isn't real but is in fact an illusion. Which the game itself calls an Intelligence save!

To address these issues, I've split wisdom in twain. Willpower is willpower, everyone gets that. The coverage of wisdom over connections, in terms of human relations, and empathy is now under Charisma, and perception is under the new Stat Perception. Connection to divine power is covered by Faith, and to primal power via the unerelated-to-the-character Verdance table.

This does leave the window open for those hankering for a sense of “wise”, as in an individual who has a broad body of experience to call upon and errs on the side of patience. Characters still have the various Knowledge skills, and there is now the "Learned" Power for wisdom in the sense of being broadly knowledgeable, educated, well-read, etc., and the “Wisened” background that is wisdom in the sense of a wide body of practiced wisdom coming from age and life experience; the non-academic sage. It is also, I find, mostly simply a matter of role-play.

### Races
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of the races.

<div id="races-container"></div>

#### Racial Powers
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of Powers available to your Race, representing in-born abilities (some are generically available, some are race-specific, all can only be chosen during character creation).

<div id="racial-powers-container"></div>

#### Childhood Skills & Language
Freely pick 2 general skills, representing your childhood skills, from the Skills & Proficiency section below, and additionally take the 'Language, one of' Skill, noting your Childhood Language on your character sheet. By default in my games in the Materium Existentiae, your Childhood Language will be Imperial Common.

### Backgrounds
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of the Backgrounds.

Backgrounds are the primary source of non-martial skills, as they're literally the skills you pursued professionally.

<div id="backgrounds-container"></div>

#### Background Stats
As part of your background, you will gain +1 to two Stats.

#### Background Powers
WIP - a shortlist of all Powers that can be taken as your Background Power.

Choose a Power from your time as your background. It must be related to the activities of your background.

<div id="background-powers-container"></div>

### Skills & Proficiency
Another part of PEDD is the flattening of the odd little distinct yet related categories of "Skills, Tools, Languages and Weapon & Armor Proficiencies". They all are now "Skills" in which you have "Proficiency", or not. Being Proficienct means being able to apply your Bonus.

Weapons have also been regrouped into "Weapon Classes", no longer "Simple" and "Martial" and no longer taken for Proficiency individually. The old system was too fine-grained as well as bizarrely too broad as most gained weapon proficiencies through the massive sets "Simple" and "Martial" via their classes. 

Body, representing proficiency with unarmed combat, has been introduced as a Simple Weapon Skill, to remove Unarmed Combat from its odd state of limbo. And yes, due to being promoted to a Stat, Perception is no longer a Skill.

In PEDD no Skill is automatically associated with a Stat, though there are suggestions as naturally certain Skills tend to be handled by certain Stats. However if played well, you can Intimidate with Charisma using guile, Stealth with Intelligence using knowledge of the terrain and the enemy, and do Acrobatics with Accuracy while juggling, depending on how you use the Skill. The GM and the table will decide if a combination is valid, or if another combination would be better.

**Note** for weapon attacks, the Stats used are fixed: Strength for Melee, Accuracy for Ranged (unless a property of the weapon or some Power allows you to choose another Stat).

Skills are primarily earned by your Background, the skills you learned to do during your profession, but also from your Role: and some racial Powers also give skills, those in born natural abilities of a race.

WIP - turn the below into a list of selectable skills / automatically selected based on other character choices, and custom to have a text input. Prompt for the number of untrained/trained free picks left.
<div class="proficiencies-list">

</div>

#### General, Trained and Martial Skills
For ease of use, skills are separated into four groups; 
- **General Skills** - which most of the time anyone can attempt the actions that would be governed by this skill even if they're not proficient.
- **Trained Skills** - which most of the time you cannot attempt the actions that would be governed by this skill unless proficient.
- **Martial Skills** - skills with weapons, armour and shields. A subset exists for General Skills, i.e. "Simple Weapons", and for Trained Skills, i.e. "Skilled Weapons".

This is not to say anyone can attempt all General Skill checks (proficient or not) or that without proficiency you can never attempt any Trained Skill check, as it depends on the scenario and is a DM (me) call, which players can argue in either direction as best fits the understanding of the table.

If you gain a Skill that you already have proficiency in, you can pick a different skill of that category (General, Trained, or Martial).

#### Martial Skill Prerequisites and Downgrading Skills
*Certain Martial Skills marked with an * require proficiency in other skills before they can be taken. 
- Heavy Armour requires Medium Armour which requires Light Armour. 
- Battle-Axes and Mauls require Clubs & Axes.
- Heavy Blades requires Blades which requires Knives.
- Pole-Arms requires Spears

If a Background grants you a skill proficiency in a Skill you don't have the prerequisites for, "downgrade" the Skill to its prerequisite (unless, during character creation, you get the Skill from elsewhere).

#### General Skills 
The suggested stat to base the skill check with is in brackets, though this is merely a suggestion.

<div class="proficiencies-list">

- Animal Handling (Perception)
- Athletics (Strength)
- Deception (Charisma)
- Insight (Perception)

- Custom - for martial skills not defined in the list

</div>

#### Proficiency Bonuses and Expertise
**Proficiency a.k.a. Bonus** - having Proficiency is also known as having a "Bonus" in a skill check, which means a +2, and is typically derived from having Proficiency in a Skill from your Race, Background, Role or Power, or as a Bonus in a certain scenario earned directly from a Power. This replaces 5e 'Proficiency bonus'. Every Proficiency is a Bonus, not all Bonuses are from Proficiencies, to be clear.

A special Power, “Aptitude I/II/III”, increases the value of your Bonus to +3/+4/+5.

**Expertise** - Abilities with Bonus can gain Expertise to be grant effectively a double Bonus. Every area of the game that grants Expertise should only do so when that area already has a Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again. As weapons are just another kind of Skill, Martial Skills, you can benefit from Expertise with them.

In other words, on a roll, you will never get more than your Bonus or Expertise in addition to your Stat increase, and the maximum possible increase to a dice roll is +15 (+5 Stat, +5 Bonus x2 from Expertise).

### Role
Define your Role, a single evocative phrase or demonym that is the sum of what it is that you *do* as an adventurer.  This might well be the same as or a subset of your Concept.

For example:
 - The Mage of Iron
 - Czondazani Noble Rebel
 - Ihleiskan Reaver
 - Water-burning pyromancer
 - Outback ranger
 - Ashen priestess
 - The Twin-swords of Tarentaise

WIP - Role input
<div id="role-container"></div>

#### Role Statistics
You get one final Stat increase from your Role, a +1 to one Stat of your choice and a +1 to one Resistance of your choice.

#### Role Powers
The main purpose of a Role is to embody what kind of Adventurer you are, and the powers to facilitate that are paramount. As such for your Role choose 3 Powers from PEDD any non-racial Powers: one of which must be a `combat` Power, and one of which must be an `exploration` Power. Use the tags to help you.

<div id="role-picker-container"></div>


#### Role Martial Skills
Combat is an inevitable part of adventure. In addition to any racial or background skills, as part of your Role you may freely choose 4 Martial Skills that you have the prerequisites for. These are the arms and armour of your Role, so be thematic.

#### Intelligence Skills
Including the skills granted by your race, background and role so-far, you also gain proficiency in a number of Skills equal to your Intelligence, to a minimum of 0. This is done now as your Intelligence Stat is now fixed, but consider these extra skills you've gained across your entire life, through childhood, your background and even recently as an adventuerer. 

You can pick freely from the Skills & Proficiency section.

### Equipment
Take a note of the equipment you already have from your background, and then choose one set of equipment that fits the image of your Role:

Note that any martial weapon choice can be downgraded to a simple weapon, and chain mail can be downgraded to leather armour.

WIP - selectable cards where each card lists what equipment choices the set has
<div id="equipment-list">

- The Fighter
  - Chainmail, a shield, 3 Martial Weapons of your choice, 2 Simple weapons of your choice
- The Rogue
  - Leather Armour, a melee martial weapon of your choice, a ranged martial weapon of your choice, a simple weapon of your choice, Tools (Thieves' / Leatherworker's / Woodcarver's)
- The Wizard
  - a staff, a wand, spellcasting components, Tools (Alchemist's / Herbalist's)
- The Tinker
  - Light armour, Simple Weapon, Tools, Money
- The Destitute
  - a knife, nothing extra
- The Cleric
  - medium armour, simple weapon, holy symbol
- The Druid
  - medium armour, shield, simple weapon, druidic focus
- The Warlock
  - light armour, martial weapon, occult wand

</div>

And, a pack of your choice:

<div class="proficiencies-list">

- Burglar's Pack
- Diplomat's Pack
- Dungeoneer's Pack
- Entertainers's Pack
- Explorer's Pack
- Priest's Pack
- Scholar's Pack

</div>

Weapons and armour are covered in [Weapons & Armour in PEDD/Combat](bellaby.co.uk/pedd/combat#weapons-and-armour)

### Converting Races, Backgrounds and Classes

#### Features
First, any and all Features can be taken as written so long as any areas of the game they touch haven't been effected by changes in PEDD. Those that do will need adjusting, and some Features have been rewritten wholesale, such as Spellcasting (which has its own section in powers [here](#spheres-of-magic)). See the points below.

**Ability Score Increases** - any "Ability Score Increase" features are constrained to, at maximum, two +1's in the stated abilities. Any base-race - subrace combinations with 3 or more ability score increases only increase 2 Stats by +1, and you can choose which two. Any increases to Dexterity can instead be increases to Accuracy. Any increases to wisdom are instead increases to your choice of Perception or Willpower.

**Perception Proficiency** - any feature that gives proficiency in perception instead grants the Keen Sense Power.

**Saving Throw Proficiency** - any feature that gives a saving throw proficiency instead gives +1 to the corresponding Resistance (see [Converting Saves](#converting-saves))

#### Races
Races have been tweaked in a number of ways. Go through the following steps to convert a Race:

1. Use the original Age, Size and Speed. Add a description for the race in the Materium Existentiae.
2. Adjust the Attribute Increase feature to reflect the pattern: ["A Stat +2", "Another Stat +1", "A third Stat -1", "A Resistance +1"]. Adjust using other races as examples if necessary. Combine sub-races if necessary.
3. Add Senses, this may include darkvision if it is a required part of the fantasy of the race.
4. Introduce Baseline Health (default: 6 base, -1 for small, +1 for large, -2 for weak, +2 for strong) and Evasion bonus or malus for graceful / bulky races respectively.
5. Remove any Skill proficiencies not distinctly tied to the physicality of the race (such as weapon or tool proficiencies)
6. Remove all other features and make them the Racial Powers options for that Race, including from all sub-races.
7. Create a list of Racial Powers from the removed Features, converting each Feature to a Power, and include any other racial powers to that list that should apply (check with your GM). If a Racial Power is iconic (it cannot be removed without intrinsically damaging the fantasy of the race), keep it as a named feature of the race. (Such as Lucky, for the Halfling).
