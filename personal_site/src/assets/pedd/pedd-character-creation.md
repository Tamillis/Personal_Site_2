## Character Creation
Trinitas is so named for the three pillars of a character: their race, their background and their role.

As a step 0., players are asked to consider their [character concept](#character-concept) that they'll carry through character creation, guiding their choices which in tern refine their concept.

Step-By-Step Character creation in Trinitas looks like this:
0. *Create a Character Concept* - in a phrase, define the core of your character. Who is it that they *are*? What is it that they *do*?
1. *Choose a Race* - the circumstances of your being. Choose one Race, giving the following base statistics and features:
   1. Stat Changes - typically a +2, +1 and -1
   2. Secondary Stats - Size (giving base health and defence), Age, Size, Speed and Senses
   3. Racial Features - some races have inherent racial features - like inbuilt Powers
   4. Racial Powers - A pick of (typically) 2 of the Racial Powers available to that Race
   5. Your Upbringing - You also get 2 non-martial skills and one language of your choice - the childhood skills and native language that represent your upbringing
2. *Choose a Background* - the circumstances of your way of life before adventuring. They give the following:
   1. Stat Increases - +1 to 2 Stats
   2. 6 Skills - the skills of your background.
   3. Equipment - Some initial equipment you've kept from your background days
   4. Background Power - You're free to choose one power from the Background category that thematically matches your envisioned background, though one is suggested.
3. *Choose your Role* - the way that you adventure and tackle the world. You choose the following:
   1.  Stat Increases - a +2 to a Stat of your choice, and a +1 to another Stat of your choice.
   2.  Role Skills - 4 + a number of Skills equal to your Character's (now final) Intelligence of Skills. It's suggested to pick up some martial skills if you lack the ability to defend yourself at this stage.
   3.  Your initial 3 adventuring Powers (see [Powers Progression](/pedd/powers)), chosen from any non-racial Power: one of which must be a `combat` Power, and one of which must be an `exploration` Power. 
   4. Adventuring Equipment - chose your Equipment from one of the collections; the equipment that you find yourself with just before the game begins. The use of equipment is roughly identical to 5e.

### Character Concept
While not a new idea, before character creation proper I ask you, the players, to think of a core character concept: a fantasy person they would like to play, to inhabit and act out. It will form a basis you can build on instead of the trap of a race or class as the old way lent itself to be. (I've seen many, many newbies open an RPG book and then go "I want to be a Dwarf Ranger", or what have you. That's not a character, that's a video game avatar).

Of course, your concept will be a fluid thing, and is expected to change as you go through character creation and - choosing slightly different-to-expected options as you go - you refine the concept. 

Your Character Concept leads directly into your Role, so its best to make it a single evocative phrase or demonym that is the sum of what it is that you *do* as an adventurer.

For example:
 - The Mage of Iron
 - Noble Rebel of the Czondazani Cause
 - An Ex-Ihleiskan Reaver
 - A Water-burning pyromancer
 - Outback ranger & his trusty yak
 - Priestess of the forgotten Ashen Gods
 - The Renowned Twin-sword Duelist of Tarentaise

Also as part of step 1, I ask you to think of your character's **Bonds**, **Ideals** and **Flaws**: to lead with them rather than slap them on later. But feel free to return to them and add as you go through each step of character creation, of course. They are otherwise unchanged from 5e. Remember to lean on these (and your GM) to earn Inspiration.

### Statistics

All characters have 6 **Statistics**, a.k.a. "Stats", with a single value ranging from -3 to +5. (These values are higher and lower for monsters and "Super humans", with in-system values running from -5 to +10).

The six **Statistics** are:
- **Accuracy** - used in ranged attacks, and feats of precision
- **Perception** - used to sense the world, spot hidden things, and read others
- **Strength** - used in melee attacks, and feats of brawn
- **Dexterity** - used in many skills, for feats of deftness
- **Intelligence** - used to learn knowledge, understand puzzles and in cunning and manipulation, for feats of alacrity
- **Charisma** - used to move others through force of personality, empathy and displays of emotion, genuine or otherwise

These are used to build the 3 **Resistances**:
- **Reflexes** - the ability to avoid harms. Calculated from the average of **Accuracy** and **Perception**.
- **Fortitude** - the ability of the body to throw off and work-through ills. Calculated from the average of **Strength** and **Dexterity**.
- **Willpower** - the ability of the mind to resist. Calculated from the average of **Intelligence** and **Charisma**.

Round up if not a whole number (i.e. for 2 Accuracy and -1 Perception, that character has 1 Reflexes).

Statistics are active and used for Checks and Actions, whereas your passive Resistances are used used reactively: to mitigate harms.

The idea behind the particular Stats is the following schema of worldy-interaction:
| - | Direct | Indirect | Reactive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ***External*** | Accuracy | Perception | Reflexes |
| ***Liminal*** | Strength | Dexterity | Fortitude |
| ***Internal*** | Charisma | Intelligence | Willpower |

The trinitas of action:
- Direct affect, when a character affects the world and its actors directly.
- Indirect application, where interaction is more subtle and an affect is coaxed out.
- Reactive response, where a character is moved by the world.

The trinitas of origin:
- External Stats affect the world at a distance from a character
- Limenal means at point of contact.
- Internal of course means interaction through the lense of the character's inner world: their mentality.

#### Stat Values
Stat Value | Meaning
--- | ---
-3 | Severely Handicapped - even menial tasks are difficult
-2 | Handicapped - most basic tasks are difficult
-1 | Below Average - you fail to overcome most challenges
0 | Average - unremarkable, equivalent to an unskilled labourer
1 | Capable - you're more capable than the unskilled
2 | Professional - you're trusted to succeed
3 | Exceptional - you're renowned within the region
4 | World-class - few in the nation can best you
5 | Legendary - your capability is on the level of myth

Stats are determined by your Race, Background and Role, which produces a meaningful spread of Stats. There is no system for rolling stats. 

#### World-Class Beginnings
During character creation no Statistic can be increased beyond +4, unless explicitly stated. If a Race, Background or Role would raise a Stat above 4, instead you may raise a different Stat (again, not above 4).

#### Having Faith
If you get involved in matters of the divine, your Faith as a statistic becomes important, although other characters are also welcome to have and track their Faith (note, do not calculate Faith like other Statistics, instead Faith is a value starting at 2 that is affected by your character's actions during play, see Divine Spellcasting):
- **Faith** - the attunment of your soul to the divine path of your deity / path / philosophy.

#### Passive Stats
Sometimes enemy attacks and other effects are made against your "Resistance DC" or other passive stat. This is 8 + the Stat/Resistance value.

#### Secondary Statistics

- **Size** - what category of size you are, determined by Race. Your base defence and many combat interactions depend on Size.
- **Speed** - the ground you can cover in a Move, determined by your Race and some Powers
- **Health** - how much damage you can take before entering the Dying state. Your Race provides your **Base Health** and your **Fortitude** + **Willpower** is added on top to determine your total Health. Health is explicitly a combination of physical and emotional wear and tear, and the ability to roll with and carry on from blows.
- **Defence** - how difficult you are to harm. **Base Defence** + **Armour** + **Reflexes (as limited by armour, minimum of 0)**
  - **Base Defence** - determined by Size: 14 (tiny), 10 (small), 8 (medium), 6 (large), 2 (huge). Smaller characters are harder to hit.
  - **Armour** - determined by the sum Defence of worn equipment.
  - **Reflexes** - your **Reflex** value to a minimum of 0 and limited by Armour. Some Powers may also affect this value.
- **Focus** - your **Willpower** value to a minimum of 1. Used in certain Tactical Actions.

<h4><a id="toggle-tertiary">Tertiary Statistics...</a></h4>

<div id="tertiary-section" class="hidden">

These 'Statistics' are not used in the game explicitely, but are a fun little aside for calculating ancilliary values for your character. Feel free to skip this step if you're not interested, or completely ignore its results.

- **Appearance** - the comeliness of your visage, **Strength** + **Charisma**
- **Agility** - the speed and adroitness with which you move, **Dexterity** + **Accuracy**
- **Foresight** - your ability to predict how things will come out moment-to-moment, **Perception** + **Intelligence**

A few Powers may use these Stats, but only explicitely as the combination of normal Stats that define them, such as with "Foresighted Defence" which is built upon Perception and Intelligence.

### Races
Your race is what you were born as. The choices your character had no hand in making (which is why it includes Upbringing). Your physical circumstances, your family, childhood, place of birth, home and all these little factors. When chosing a Race consider these, and consider what bonds (family, friends, childhood haunts), what ideals (beliefs you were raised with), and flaws (deep-rooted assumptions, traumas, rivals) you may have too.

Make a note of any **Racial Features** you may have.

#### Racial Powers
You choose 2 Racial Powers when you choose a Race unless a Racial Feature says otherwise. With these options not even two individuals of the same Race have the same capabilities, necessarily, and often hail from differing and distant heritages. 

You are welcome to choose more Racial Powers of your Race as part of progression if it makes sense at the table, as you unlock latent capabilities etc.

#### Upbringing
Your 'upbringing' is the kind of childhood you had. You freely pick 2 non-martial Skills, representing your those you were taught, learned or had no choice but to pick up while growing up. Additionally you take the 'Languages (one)' Skill, noting that as your native language. By default in my games in the Materium Existentiae, your Childhood Language will be Imperial Common.

Note that even if you don't have the common language of the campaign you're playing, such as Imperial Common, you are still considered conversational in it. You just don't get Proficiency in any social interactions using it, and you're considered to have a noticable accent, poor grammar and narrow vocabulary. Generally, for other languages, if you're not proficient with it you cannot attempt to speak it.

### Backgrounds
Your background is the profession and/or way of life you pursued before taking on the mantle of 'Adventurer' and you left it all behind, or were forced to. It emphasises skills, those you honed to a professional level, more than Powers, of which you gain only one. These are your character's first true choices, and so may say a lot about their ideals and their flaws, or represent a significant bond of theirs.

### Role
Who you are as an adventurere, the means with which you adventure! Your Character Concept should evoke an idea of the kind of powers you'll need.

#### Role Powers
The main purpose of a Role is to embody what kind of Adventurer you are, and the powers to facilitate that are paramount. As such for your Role choose 3 Powers from any non-racial Powers: one of which must be a `combat` Power, and one of which must be an `exploration` Power. Use the tags to help you. Your Role will only grow as you play, gaining more Powers, and therefore Skills and Stats.

[See Powers here](/trinitas/powers)

#### Role Skills
In addition to the skills granted by your race and background so-far, you also gain proficiency in a number of Skills equal to 4 + your Intelligence. You've gained skills across your entire life: through childhood and your background, so consider these Skills those you've learned and had to use as an adventuerer, in particular any martial skills you most likely are currently lacking in. These are the arms and armour of your Role, so be thematic.

You can pick any skills freely from [Skills](/trinitas/skills) section.

#### Equipment
Finally, the possessions you have on you at the start of your adventure. Take a note of the equipment you already have from your background, and then choose one collection of equipment that fits the image of your Role: [See Collections](/trinitas/equipment#equipment-collections)

When you have options (denoted by a /), choose 1. The packs and tool kits are suggestions, you can take any pack or toolkit.

Pack's, for reference (you may with your GM's permission swap your pack for any other pack): [See Packs](/trinitas/equipment#equipment-packs)

See the Weapons and Armour sections for details about those specific items.
