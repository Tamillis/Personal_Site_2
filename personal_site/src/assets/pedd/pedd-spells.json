Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands. \n\n\n\n**Telepathic Connection**. While your familiar is within 100ft of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can shut off your senses and see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. \n\n\n\n**Deliver Spells**. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch instead. Your familiar must be within 100ft of you, and it must take a Action to deliver the touch when you cast the spell. \n\n\n\n**Combat**. The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar uses the stats and actions of its stat block as normal. \n\n\n\n**Destruction and Desummoning**. When the familiar drops to 0 Health, it disappears back to its home plane. When you cast this spell again, you can choose to summon the same spirit or a different one. As an Action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to its home plane. If you do so, you can cast this spell again without a Material cost to summon that same spirit. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever, as if it had reached 0 Health. When the familiar is destroyed or desummoned, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.\n\n\n\n**Changing Form**. You can't have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast the spell again while your familiar is present and within 100ft, you do not spend the material cost and you can change which Beast form it has."

        "description": "You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs must be anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) where they fill a 20ft cube, or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, where have a depth of 5ft, otherwise the spell fails. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured.\n\nThe first time a character enters the webs on a Round or starts the Round there, it must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against your Spell Save or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5ft cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 Round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any character caught in the fire."

Until the spell ends, a character that enters the spell's area for the first time in a Round or starts the Round there makes a Willpower saving throw. On a failed save, a character can't speak a deliberate lie while in the affect. You know whether a character succeeds or fails on this save. An affected character is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a character can be evasive yet must be truthful."
