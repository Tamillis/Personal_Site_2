## A remake of 5e

If I were to make a radical 5.5e of a fashion that suited my tastes and mechanical areas to explore, reformulate and refine, while keeping as much as I could, this would be that. 

"One D&D" is coming and Wizards of the Coast really put their PR foot in it with the licensing changes so we're all ready to jump ship. I instead find myself remaking the ship, taking what I think works well, and changing, exchanging and adding in what I would like it to have. A lot of the changes I've made are minor tweaks I've done over the years as I've found myself the DM for a group of newbies who I've coaxed into the hobby or given at last an outlet for their pent-up interest, and these changes better enable newer folks to enjoy the hobby without needing to work their way past legacy systems and jargon.

Taking the content of the Fifth Edition Player's Handbook as a base (meaning assume normal 5e D&D unless otherwise redefined), PEDD applies changes in three major categories: 
- a rework of the character creation system and core ability scores known as *Character Creation 5.P* 
- abolishment of the class and levelling system (including updates to nearly all features, feats and spells) known as *Power Progression*
- and a rework of the action economy and combat to increase table-engagement, speed up & simplify the work of combat and yet also enable it to be more tactical, known as *Combat 5.P*

Anything not mentioned is not changed as while this is a total homebrew makeover the base is still D&D 5e and you know what, that’s OK. It's a good base, and one we are all familiar with and that does a damn fine job, and by extending it, it means there's no need to repeat good material. It's all already there.

***

## Character Creation 5.P

Step-By-Step Character creation in PEDD looks like this:
1. *Create a Character Concept* - in a phrase, define the core of your character.
2. *Determine Ability Statistics & Resistances* - these values will be modified by Race, Background and Archetype
3. *Choose a Race* - all handbook races, and some more, are available below. See "Converting Races, Background and Classes" section for details on 5e content that doesn't appear here.
4. *Choose a Background* - all handbook backgrounds, and some more, are available below.
5. *Choose your Archetype and initial Powers* - choose an Archetype and corresponding number and kind of Powers (see [Powers Progression](#powers-progression)).
6. *Finalize Equipment* - chose and collate the starting Equipment you have from your Background and Archetype. Otherwise equipment is identical to 5e.
7. *Come Together* - [just like the base game](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#6ComeTogether)

As you work your way through these steps, select or input your inputs. This document doubles as a character creator for PEDD!

### Character Concept
While not new, I ask players to think of a core character concept (a fantasy person they would like to play, to inhabit and act out) as the very first step of character creation, to form a basis they can build on and have the basis of their character be an idea, not a race or class as the old way lent itself to be (I've seen many, many newbies open the book and then go "I want to be a Dwarf Ranger", or what have you. That's not a character, that's a video game protagonist). Of course, this is a fluid thing, and is expected to change as you go through character creation and, choosing slightly different options as you go, you redefine your character's core concept. I expect players to be constantly updating their *Core Concept* based on their mechanical choices, but not for the mechanical choices to be the basis.

As they do, they can add to their **Flaws**, **Bonds** and **Ideals** as they go through each step, but again thinking of these as part of the first step of character creation.

#### Name
<div id="character-name"></div>

#### Concept
<div id="character-concept"></div>

### Ability Statistics

The ability score into modifier system was vestigial so I removed it. All characters have "Ability Statistics", a.k.a. "Stats", a single value ranging from -3 to +5 for humanoid and player characters (higher and lower for monsters and "Super humans").

Stat Value | Meaning
--- | ---
-3 | Severely Handicapped - even menial tasks are difficult
-2 | Handicapped - most basic tasks are difficult
-1 | Below Average - you fail to overcome most challenges
0 | Average - unremarkable, equivalent to an unskilled labourer
1 | Capable - you're more capable than the unskilled
2 | Professional - you're trusted to succeed
3 | Exceptional - you're renowned within the region
4 | World-class - few in the nation can best you
5 | Legendary - your capability is on the level of the myths of the Gods

The base statistics of a character are [-2, -1, 0, 0, +1, +2]. Alternatively, dice rollers can roll 6d6, reducing each result by -3 (a 6 is 3, a 2 is -1 etc.) and record each value. If the Stats add up to more than 3 or less than 3, reroll.

Stats can be increased from Race, Background, Archetype and also during Progression. During character creation no Statistic can be increased beyond +4, unless explicitly stated. If a Race, Background or Archetype would raise a Stat above 4, instead you may raise a different Stat (again, not above 4).

#### Resistances and Statistics
A line is drawn between your active Statistics used for actions, and your passive Resistances which are used to mitigate harms. Resistances are calculated values, from Statistics, Race and Background. They can be above 4 or below -3, they are whatever the calculation comes out as.

There are six **Statistics** (used in checks):
- **[S]trength** - used in melee attacks, and feats of brawn
- **[D]exterity** - used in many skills, for feats of deftness
- **[A]ccuracy** - used in ranged attacks, and feats of precision
- **[P]erception** - used to sense the world, spot hidden things, and read others
- **[I]ntelligence** - used in knowledge and understanding, for feats of alacrity
- **[Ch]arisma** - used to affect others through force of personality, empathy and displays of emotion

And three **Resistances** (used in saves):
- **[C]onstitution** - the ability of the body to throw off ills. Calculated from **Strength** + **Dexterity**.
- **[R]eflexes** - the ability of the body to avoid harms. Calculated from **Accuracy** + **Perception**.
- **[W]illpower** - the ability of the mind to resist. Calculated from **Intelligence** + **Charisma**.

Additionally, each Race and Background has a "Resistance Profile", modifiers to your character's Resistance values. For example, Elves have a Constitution of -1, and Soldiers a Constitution of +2, meaning an Elf Soldier starts with a Constitution of **Strength**+**Dexterity**-1+2.

#### Resistance DC's
Sometimes enemy attacks and other effects are made against your "Resistance DC", this is 8 + the Resistance value.

#### Stats
WIP - Assign your Stats. (Resistances and Resistance DC's calculated from Race and Background chosen below)

<div id="stats"></div>

#### Converting Saves
Whenever 5e asks for a save of a certain kind, using the following conversion:
- Strength Saves -> Constitution Saves
- Dexterity Saves -> Reflex Saves / Constitution Saves*
- Constitution Saves -> Constitution Saves
- Intelligence Saves -> Willpower Saves
- Wisdom Saves -> Willpower Saves / Perception Saves**
- Charisma Saves -> Willpower Saves

*Dexterity is somewhat redefined as the agility and capability of one's body irrespective of their physical Strength or Accuracy. Pure dodging, then, (as most old Dexterity saves were) are covered by Reflex saves, however those old Dexterity saves that were more about the capability of the victim's body (such as jumping high enough) would now be covered by Constitution saves, which represent more one's physical ability to avoid damage. 

**Wisdom, being poorly understood by perhaps even the designers of 5e themselves, is an odd one. See "Where's Wisdom?" for my thoughts on that. By default use Willpower, but if Perception would be more appropriate, use that.

#### Secondary Statistics

- **[H]ealth** - how much damage you can take before entering the Dying state. Race, Background and Archetype all provide initial Health, and finally **Constitution** + **Willpower** is added on top. See "Health" in "Combat 5.P". Health is explicitly a combination of physical and emotional wear and tear, and the ability to roll with and carry on from blows.
- **Defence** - how difficult you are to harm. **Base Defence** + **Armour** + **Evasion**
  - **Base Defence** - determined by your Race (default 8), or overridden by some Powers.
  - **Armour** - determined by the sum Defence of worn equipment.
  - **Evasion** - your **Dexterity** value (min 0), can be modified by some Powers, can be limited by worn equipment.
- **Speed** - unchanged, determined by Race
- **Initiative** - **Perception** + **Dexterity** (+ a bonus from some Powers)
- **Passive Statistics** - sometimes Powers or play require a value to compare against. The DM can ask you to make a roll that then represents that value, and sometimes they will ask for your "Passive Strength" etc. This is 8 + the Stat Value.

#### Where's Wisdom?
Generally speaking Wisdom has been removed, with all of the D&D weirdness about 'connection' and 'perception' being part of Wisdom, even though most people use Wisdom like willpower, and it just generally having a very poorly defined and understood area of concern. It gets especially odd when many people's definitions of Wisdom start to sound a lot like Intelligence, such as having the wherewithal to notice something isn't real but is in fact an illusion. Which the game itself calls an Intelligence save!

To address these issues, I've split Wisdom in twain. Willpower is willpower, everyone gets that. The coverage of Wisdom over connections and empathy is now under Charisma, and perception is under the new Stat Perception. 

This does leave the window open for those hankering for a sense of “wise”. Characters still have the various Knowledge skills, and there is now the "Learned" Power for wisdom in the sense of being broadly knowledgeable, educated, well-read, etc., and the “Wisened” background that is wisdom in the sense of a wide body of practiced wisdom coming from age and life experience; the non-academic sage. 

### Races
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of the races.

<div id="races-container"></div>

### Racial Powers
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of Powers available to your Race, representing inborn abilities (some are generically available, some are race-specific, all can only be chosen during character creation).

Honestly might just remove.
<div id="racial-powers-container"></div>

### Backgrounds
WIP - this will be a browse-able scrolling list of the Backgrounds.

Backgrounds will be where Characters choose their skills from the given list.
<div id="backgrounds-container"></div>

### Background Powers
WIP - a shortlist of all Powers that can be taken as your Background Power (again, might just remove). 

Choose a Power from your time as your background. It must be related to the activities of your background, so confer with your DM (me).
<div id="background-powers-container"></div>

### Archetypes
V.WIP - choose your Archetype, what forms the seed of your adventuring capabilities.

Attribute Increase
Resistance Profiles
Health Bonus
Archetype | Stat Increases | Resistance Profile | Bonus Health | Bonus Skills | Power
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Brawler** | S +1, A +1 | R +1 | H +4 | Athletics, Body, Knives any 1 | Your Unarmed Attacks contain the Block I, Finesse and Parry (Bludgeoning) properties. Your Unarmed Attacks deal 1d4 damage. 
**Hunter** | A +1, P +1 | R +1 | H +2 | Bows, Survival, Tools (any 1), any 1 | You can Aim as a bonus action, granting a Bonus to the next Ranged Weapon Attack you make this turn. 
**Protector** | S +1, D +1 | C +1 | H +4 | You can make the Block action with Shields as a Bonus action. You can instead Block for an ally within 5ft of you. They gain the benefits of the Block as if they themselves blocked.
**Adept** | S +1, D +1 | C +1 | H +4 | Skill monkey. Expertise in two Skills of your choice.
**Artisan** | P +1, Ch +1 | W +1 | H +0 | You gain Proficiency in a Tool Set and Proficiency in a Skill. You also gain Expertise in a Tool Set. When not at Disadvantage, you can choose to not roll when making any Tool Set check and instead assume you rolled a 10, adding Stat and any Bonus to that as normal. 
**Mage** | S +1, D +1 | C +1 | H +0 | choose a Sphere of Magic: you gain 2 cantrips and a 1st Circle spell from that list. You also gain the Spellcasting Power for that Sphere.  


### Converting Races, Backgrounds and Classes

#### Features
First, any and all Features can be taken as written so long as any areas of the game they touch haven't been effected by changes in PEDD. Those that do will need adjusting, and some Features have been rewritten wholesale. See the points below.

**Ability Score Increases** - any "Ability Score Increase" features are constrained to, at maximum, two +1's in the stated abilities. Any base-race - subrace combinations with 3 or more ability score increases only increase 2 Stats by +1, and you can choose which two. Any increases to Dexterity can instead be increases to Accuracy. Any increases to Wisdom can instead be increases to Perception or Willpower.

**Perception Proficiency** - any feature that gives proficiency in perception instead grants +1 to the Perception Stat to a maximum of +4. Any feature that gives expertise in perception instead grants +1 to the Perception Stat to a maximum of +5.

**Saving Throw Proficiency** - any feature that gives a saving throw proficiency instead gives +1 to the corresponding Resistance stat to a maximum of +4 (see [Converting Saves](#converting-saves))

#### Races
Introduce Baseline Health and Base Defence statistics for a Race.

***

## Combat 5.P
The goal is to make combat more consistently dangerous and snappier. Low level combat was too dangerous but quickly combat became trivial, with characters that were health sponges that you end up playing whack-a-mole with. And I wanted to erase the issue of players switching off when its not their turn, which lead to the "One Action All At Once" system (see [below](#one-action-all-at-once)).

- Thus the changes to HP (as Health), Recovery, and Wounds, with Health starting higher and progressing in naturally smaller steps due to only being increased when being purposefully taken as a Power, Recovery being slower and entering the dying condition creating lasting Wounds.
- Thus [Flat Maths](#flat-maths), where Damage and other numbers are flattened and easier to parse, and a sword and other such things will always be dangerous, to the same degree.
- Thus the AC rework as Defence, see [Character Creation](#secondary-statistics), which makes it more likely for a character to be hit (with the lower base defence, necessity of raising shields, Stationary Defence, etc.), unless they do something like defensive actions (parry/dodge/block/raise shield) or take Defence boosting Powers (Int/Cha/Per).

#### Recovery
Hit Dice are also an older mechanic that is mostly vestigial. It too is removed. Resting (short or long) recovers your Race's Baseline Health, until your Health is back at its maximum. Long rests also only recover your Baseline Health, but are otherwise unchanged.

Once you have regained Health from Short Rests twice, you cannot regain Health from a third Short Rest until you have completed a Long Rest. Meaning, per day, you can at maximum regain 3 × your Race's Baseline Health.

That means, at a maximum, you can gain your Baseline Health (without modification from Powers) twice, once from a short rest and once from a long rest, per day. If you seek medical attention or healing spells, however, you may yet recover a lot more Health in a day.

#### Wounds
**Wounded X** - When your Health is reduced to 0 and you don't already have the Wounded condition, you go Unconscious as usual and you gain the Wounded 1 condition. Each time you go Unconscious from your Health dropping to 0, your Wounded condition increases by 1. 

When you make Death Saves, the DC is not 10, it is your Wounded condition rank × 5. So at Wounded I, Death Saves are made against a DC of 5.

The wounded condition loses one rank per Long Rest, and one rank per successful Medicine check made against a DC of the Wounded condition rank × 5 (the same like a Death Save). This Medicine check can be made once per day on a character, regardless of success or failure.

#### Flat Maths
If 5e made the math linear from quadratic 3.Xe, PEDD seeks to make the math flat, making it easier to predict and interpret, and also aiding with the level-less system. It also has the added benefit of making something that was dangerous, always dangerous. Flat Maths means nothing "falls off".

To aid in the caluclation of the Maths, the following assumptions are kept to:
- "*peasants*" face an average DC of 10, hit at +0/+3 (unskilled, skilled, unskilled being the norm), have 10 Defence and have 8-12 Health. 
- "*adventurers*" face an average DC of 15, hit at +2/+5 (unskilled, skilled, skilled being the norm), have 15 Defence, and have 20-30 health. 

As such, all damage sources need to be re-calibrated; various high-level spells and large monsters are brought down, making the face-value of such abilities easier for newer players to read. ("Oh my go, a D12 of damage!?" Vs the relatively opaque 4d6 damage of a fireball). Two sword strikes, a fireball, or a headshot (e.g. a critical) will drop you to 0 Health.

#### Full, Unarmoured and Stationary Defence
The Defence Stat is more flexible than being a flat value made of three parts: 
- a base value from your Race (typically 8)
- an Armour value determined by worn Equipment
- an Evasion value, Dexterity to a minimum of 0 which can be limitted by worn Equipment. 
  
Instead Defence is calculated when required from these three parts, depending on what parts are in play. This gives us three kinds of Defence;
- **Full Defence** - Defence with both Armour and Evasion
- **Unarmoured Defence** - Defence without Armour, armour limits on Evasion are still applied. A few effects target Unarmoured Defence.
- **Stationary Defence** - Defence without the benefit of Evasion, often called "touch AC" in other systems. Some effects target Stationary Defence.

Remember that the Armour value also changes during play as you don and doff Equipment, and especially based on whether you Raise your Shield or not!

### One Action All At Once
A major change I've experimented a little with is a radical change to basic combat where, simply, all characters in a round of combat have one action, and everyone "acts" at once, no initiative.

How on Earth does that work? You might be thinking.

All enemies in the scene declare their intentions, just as their movements would give away what they're about to do. Then all players decide among themselves what they're going to do that round. When everyone is happy with their actions, you "resolve" the round in whatever order works.

For any situations where the order of actions matters, the two characters involved roll off with initiative, or for "slow" enemies / mooks the GM will just let the players go first, player's advantage.

Most actions, however, can be resolved simultaneously. Attacks for example; two people just try to hit each other, damage each other, and collapse wounded at the same time.

Since everyone gets only one action, the action bonus-action movement economy of 5e is radically simplified. Movement is simply another action, making the "Dash" action the "Movement Action" synonymous. Bonus actions are mostly unchanged but are best thought of as 'concurrent actions' happening at the same time and therefore not significantly interrupting the character's main action. Reactions, interestingly, disappear. 

**Converting Reactions** - Any "Reactions" are considered "Actions".

#### Engagement
To help with handling fights with little to no initiative and create a natural ebb-and-flow to combat, combatants are "paired off" in **Engagements**. These are the momentary pairs or small groups that naturally form in the middle of any chaotic fight, and allows us as the players to "zoom in" on little microcosms of fights with the camera, as it were, focusing on pairing after pairing.

Engagements are resolved effectively simultaneously and the order of Engagements doesn’t matter, as with only 1 action per turn melees rarely effect each other.

All combat is resolved in two simple steps:

1. **Determine Engagements** - where combatents, according to their ["Zone of Engagement"](#zone-of-engagement) “pair off”. “Pulling” and “turning” if in conflict are rolled off. Any who intend to move do, engaging if necessary.
2. **Resolve Engagements** - resolving pairs/groups in a sensible/cinematic sequence. Melee conflicts are easily resolved. Ranged attacks naturally involve unpaired individuals; resolve simultaneously with everyone else. Resolve conflicts of interest with an Initiative roll off like normal (I try to grab the bag of gold before him, for example). 

If it makes sense to resolve conflicts of interest using appropriate skill checks rather than Initiative (i.e. Athletics), then do so.

#### Zone of Engagement
The rules of pairing off, pulling and turning. 

How do you avoid a long conga-line chain of awkwardly connected characters fighting each other? "Pairing off". Sometimes even if you want to attack Mr A, even if they're attacking Mr B, because Mr C is attacking you and is otherwise unengaged, you have no choice but to "**Turn**" and "**Pair Off**" with them. 

A character can only attempt to engage one character at a time. You can only melee attack someone you’re engaged with. Conga-lines break as if you, who are engaging someone who is engaging someone else, are engaged by a fourth, you must “turn” and engage your attacker, with the attacker **“Pulling”**. I.e., you cannot be "pulled" if you are engaged with someone who is engaged with you.

Additionally, a character can only be engaged by a maximum number of characters according to their size. Sometimes someone is surrounded by attackers, and even if you wanted to join in on the bullying, you're crowded out. The maximum number of opponents a character of a given size can have is:
- tiny/small - 1
- medium - 2
- large - 4
- gargantuan - 8

**Flanking** - changed. You are "Flanking" when you are the one in an Engagement who the foe isn’t engaging. You cannot flank a creature 2 or more sizes larger than you.

#### Additional Actions
Also, to make martial combat spicier a variety of generally available tactical basic combat actions are added; 
- **Charge** - a linear move that allows 1 attack at advantage as a bonus action if over half your movement was traversed.
- **Dodge** - an action where you make a Reflex Saving Throw and if the result is higher than your Defence, it replaces your Defence value for the rest of the round
- **Block** - as a Bonus Action, you raise your weapon or shield to gain the item's block value as Armour. This prevents you using that item as a weapon to attack. The Armour bonus lasts for the rest of the round
- **Parry** - if your weapon has the Parry Property, you make an Attack Action against an enemy who is making a melee attack against you. The roll is your Defense for the rest of this round, and also functions as a normal attack action.
- **Disengage** - as a Bonus Action, move 5ft without triggering Attacks of Opportunity. (Functionally "Step" from pathfinder, replaces 5e Feature "Disengage")
- **Stand** - a Bonus Action to go from Prone to Standing.
- **Go to cover / Go prone** - as a Bonus Action make yourself Prone, or enter adjacent cover. The Prone condition or being in cover uses Stationary Defence. As before Prone makes being shot at occur at disadvantage, and cover is +2/+5 to Defence for half / ¾ cover.
- **Attack of Opportunity** - as a Bonus Action to an enemy you're engaged with moving away from you without Disengaging from you, you can make an attack action on them, after which they have moved away and are no longer engaged with you for that Round.

***

## Power Progression
An abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replaced with "Powers" (created from Features and Feats) with a more story-driven Power by Power development system.

Progression, then, is the acquisition of more Powers and proficiencies. Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of prerequisites, typically Stats, other powers and also “After n or more Powers”, or "Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power". These are noted in brackets before the description of the Power.

"Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power" means n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken, and the same again if taking this power again. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers.

This means (as both Hearty and Hale are "Once every 2<sup>nd</sup> Power" Powers) the following is a valid combination of Powers:
1. Brawler
2. Hearty I
3. Hale I
4. Hearty II
5. Hale II

Powers have some meta categories:
- Innate Powers – cannot be trained in normal progression
- Unique Powers - can only be taken once
- Difficult - Powers that take longer than usual to learn

Powers are “in training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power.

For the intended "power level" of a Power, take any Feat from the PHB which has a Stat increase component, and remove the Stat increase.

Spellcasting is a Feature that has had to receive major reworking, and is still WIP.

### Proficiencies Rework; PEDD Skills
A subset of Powers Progression is flattening the odd little distinct yet related categories of "Skills, Tools, Languages and Weapon & Armor Proficiencies". They are now flattened, and all are now "Skills". Weapons have also been regrouped into "Weapon Classes", no longer "Simple" and "Martial" and no longer taken for Proficiency individually, as that's too fine-grained. That, and the fact that in PEDD no skill is automatically associated with a Stat, gives us the flat list:

(And yes, due to being promoted to a Stat, Perception is removed)

<div class="proficiencies-list">

- Acrobatics
- Animal Handling

</div>

#### Proficiency Bonuses and Expertise
**Bonus** - Proficiency Bonus is simply "Bonus", which means +2, and is typically derived from Proficiency and Powers, a characters skill in an area. Having "proficiency" in a tool or skill means gaining a Bonus to rolls made with that tool/skill.

A Power, “Aptitude I/II”, increases that to +3/+4. Bonus applies to more than just proficiencies, many Powers now key off it explicitly. That being said any reference to being “Proficient” still means having a Bonus. 

**Expertise** - Abilities with Bonus can gain Expertise to be grant effectively a double Bonus. Every area of the game that grants Expertise should only do so when that area already has a Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again.

### *Example Powers*
**Artisan** – gain proficiency in a Tool Set and proficiency in a Skill. You also gain Expertise in a Tool Set. When not at Disadvantage, you can choose to not roll when making any Tool Set check and instead assume you rolled a 10, adding Stat and any Bonus to that as normal.

**Brawler** – (Unique) Your Unarmed Attacks contain the Block I, Finesse and Parry (bludgeoning) properties. Your Unarmed Attacks deal d4 damage.

**Combat Expert** – (Proficiency with a martial weapon) You can Engage one more enemy, up to the maximum number possible for your Size

**Hale** – (Once per 2 Powers) Rests grant an additional Constitution + Willpower (to a minimum of 1) as well to Health recovery.

**Hardy** - (Once per 2 Powers) Add your Constitution & Willpower (to a minimum of 1) to your Health total

**Hunter** – (Unique) You can Aim as a bonus action, granting a Bonus to the next Ranged Weapon Attack you make this turn.

**Innate Spells** – (Spellcasting Initiate I), learn two spells from your known spell lists. You cannot learn spells of a Circle you cannot yet cast.

**Learned** power – gain expertise in history, arcana or religion.

**Magical Reserve** Power – determines spell slots. “Once Every 2nd Power”. Progression down the old spell slot table but with relabelled terms; spell casts, magnitude. Explicitly state all higher magnitude casts can be “down cast”, and that certain spells can be “Up Cast” as described in their spell description.

**Protector** – (Unique) You can make the Block action with Shields as a Bonus action. You can instead block for an ally within 5ft of you. They gain the benefits of the block as if they themselves blocked.

**Quick Recovery** – when Resting regain Baseline Health x2 Health. Can be taken again for x3 after 5 or more Powers, then finally once more for x4 affect after 10 or more Powers.

**Resistance Increase** – (Once every 5<sup>th</sup> Power), increase a Resistance by +2

**Run and Gun** – (Unique) you can Run and Gun as an action, where you can make a ranged weapon attack at disadvantage after making a move action as a bonus action. You may instead fire and then move.

**Spellcasting Initiate** – choose a Sphere of Magic: Arcane, Divine, Occult or Primal. You gain 2 cantrips and a 1st Circle spell from that list. You also gain the Spellcasting Power for that Sphere. You can take this Power again if you can and do choose a different Sphere of Magic.

**Stat Increase** – (Once every 5<sup>th</sup> Power), increase a Statistic by +1
