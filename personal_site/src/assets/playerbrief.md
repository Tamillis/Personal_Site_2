I run D&D pretty much everywhere I go, as it's one of my favourite and deepest passions. A table-top roleplaying game is unlike anything else, a piece of live theatre, boardgame, and creative co-operative story telling all in one. I never can find the words to describe it properly.

I've been running it for over 10 years since I was 16, and by far the most popular system at my tables has been Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. My grandest of world building projects, also visible on this site, is my go to setting for it, and itself was built around the assumed setting that D&D functions around.

For players in my games, this page is a starting point of any campaign for them to dig into the slight changes I often use, and for any visitors I hope it can give you ideas and perhaps even introduce you to some new and exciting content. While I use the base game mostly as is, I have this following collection of homebrew that I have curated from the internet or on occasion come up with myself.

## Master Player Brief 

This is the master brief, the default applicable rules I run on top of D&D 5th Edition, regardless of setting. Some setting specific modifications may be made, and I would tell you about those. 

### Official Material I run: 

All D&D 5e official WoTC printed books, including those that come out in the future (PHB, SCAG, Xanathar's, etc). I run Unearthed Arcana material on an open trial basis, where I retain the right to modify or remove UA material if it becomes an issue. With regards to the Class Variant Features UA the ‘Spell Versatility’ features are not allowed, as they break my in-universe laws of magic. UA that is considered retired, such as those since the release of Tasha’s, I don’t allow by default (though as usual you can ask).

If there's something from 3rd Party, or Homebrew you desperately want please run it by me first. I'm not just going to say no.

***

### Homebrew I run: 

The following collection of vetted-by-me homebrew (subject to oversight and at-the-table balancing). The only homebrew that replaces default rules is Weapons Revised, which provides a more balanced, nuanced and slight power up to weapons and weapon users, so please at least skim it. It is marked with an asterisk *.  

The compendiums are high-quality compilations of whole swathes of options in the style of Xanathar’s, and I do recommend taking a peek if you want to try something new or are looking for novel character ideas. I also would love to playtest them, so there’s that too.

### Personal Homebrew  

**Armouries of the Second Empire** – should we be playing in the Age of Man setting, or something similar, the following are a list of firearms, firearms rules, and items from the Second Empire; 

<a href="./mewiki/ArmouriesOfTheSecondEmpire">Armouries of the Second Empire</a>

**Dryad Prestige Class** – it is a work in progress, but needs testing to find the feel of it. Characters who have had their soul bonded to a tree by a powerful fey start to become dryads, and as they indulge in their new nature, they grow into the powers described within. This is a "Prestige Class" that only goes up to level 10 and is intended to be taken through multiclassing. You may take dryad as your first level, perhaps that is indeed how your adventuring career started. 

https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aq2B34oritBLmwCCFfCDkprcPJr6?e=EtBUdW 

**Free Mage** - Those called Free Mages are able to tug on mana and shape it to produce spell-like effects, these folks are often mistaken for sorcerers. Unlike sorcerers, however, who have a native ability to accrue and apply spell weaves, free magi employ pure mana, their own or the raw caustic stuff of the weave. Without any intervening or structuring spell, they shape it in each moment with deft acuity and precision, using their mind alone. These broad effects can be spell-like and brutally effective, but dangerous in the extreme, lacking the complexity, finesse and failsafes of structured spells. Not to mention the Soul Burn effect of using unfiltered raw mana not acclimatised to one’s own lifeforce. 

https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aq2B34oritBLkibbbOc8gfxWQpLJ?e=Ic3EJj

**Magus** - My own take on the popular Magus, a WIP that's mechanically done but not yet undergone the process of converting it to the clear consistent language of the PHB and surrounding flavour text. Let me know if you're interested.

**Potion Maker** - very much a WIP

### Personal Homebrew Rules 
We will be playing with all the optional rules we all take for granted, like feats, background variants, multiclassing and flanking. In addition, we will play with my personal homebrew rules, a list of small rules tweaks and additions. Rules marked with an asterisk * are important to normal character creation; 

**Accessing Bags and Items** – accessing any bags, packs, or items not stored in purposefully easily accessible locations, such as a purpose-built pocket, a bandoleer, a holster, or a sheath (or so on), is an action, as you take off a bag, rummage around in it, withdraw the item, and put the bag back on (or equivalent). Such items, in particular potions of healing, do not fit in normal pockets, though certain custom-made holsters may do the trick. Accessing any items in purposefully easily accessible locations like this is instead a bonus action.  

The act of consuming or administering any potion/poison/etc., like normal drinking, is considered part of the action / bonus action. Items that are used as an action, such as a medical kit or trap, are not accessed as part of their use action, so be prepared. 

**Background Feat & Normal+ Humans*** – you pick one feat at character creation, as if you have a character level of 1 (but otherwise classless), in addition to normal character creation. However, this feat must be related to your background, such as Skulker for the Criminal background. This can be any available feat as allowed by the core or expanded rules, such as the features come feats in the table below. Because of this, the *Variant Human* and *Custom Lineage* are not available. Instead you may choose a "Normal Human+", using the non-variant human plus an additional Skill Proficiency of your choice and an additional Tool Proficiency of your choice, and just as always, you can be the statistics of a race while skinning it as something else.

**Cultural Languages*** – There are no racial languages, but cultural languages in their stead, such as Imperial Common. Characters grow up speaking their culture's language, and the setting’s Common if their home culture is not that. Additional ‘racial’ languages are instead additional cultural languages. Knowledge of language comes from culture and nurture, not from blood. That said, exotic languages (such as draconic) are considered an aspect of magic, and (like normal) may not be taken as a ‘racial’ language without DM consent. See the 'Languages' section of the setting for details and the various cultural languages. 

**No Colossal Flanking** – Flanking cannot be earned on creatures two or more sizes larger than you. 

**Flanking from Facing** – when engaging a creature in melee you are said to be ‘facing’ that creature. When attacking a creature in melee who is not facing you, you gain advantage due to flanking. Creatures not already engaged automatically ‘face’ the incoming attacker. At the end of the turn creatures declare who they face until the start of their next turn, if not immediately obvious. Players with the *Extra Attack* feature and creatures with *Multi-attack* can face a number of creatures at once equal to their total number of attacks (effectively requiring a number of attackers equal to the number of their attacks for an additional attacker to gain advantage from flanking). Note that only the creature/s not being faced gain advantage.

**Hitting Cover** – Ranged attacks against creatures in cover hit the cover if the player rolls the cover value or below on the dice (so 1-2 for half cover and 1-5 in three quarter cover). Creatures in 5ft with creatures of their size or larger are treated as being in half cover (+2 bonus to AC) by their enemy, meaning creatures in melee provide cover for each other. Creatures in 5ft with creatures two sizes larger (or bigger) are in three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC). Don’t shoot your allies now!  

**Improved Standard Array*** – we will be using my version of the standard array. I find the original a little underwhelming for Heroic Adventuring, and also poorly balanced between odd and even values. So, we will use; 
16, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9 
This array also modifies the total points for those using Point Buy to 30. Feel free to use the calculator below to help you out if using Point Buy instead.

**Injury Risk** – when a character goes unconscious in a fight, next to their death saves, they tally a mark, an "injury risk". At the end of the fight characters that have injury risks make a constitution saving throw vs a DC equal to the number of risks x5 (so one risk is a DC 5, two risks DC 10, etc.) and erase the marks. If they fail, their temporary harms develop into a permanent injury, and they roll on the injury table found on page 272 of the DMG, otherwise the risk abates and they suffered only temporary wounds. Depending on the injury, the DM in collaboration with the players may adjudicate a different permanent injury. 

**Skill Per Intelligence*** – intelligence is one of the weakest statistics mechanically, leading many to take it as a dump statistic and shoe-horning their character to be played as a dumbass (though sometimes this can be fun, no mistake, it should be a choice not a compromise). In an attempt to reconnect Intelligence to Skills, their old domain, and boost its worth; when creating a character, you select a number of skills from your class’ skill list equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier (to a total minimum of 0), not the number stated.  

In the unlikely situation where high level characters find themselves with the *Expertise* feature and no skills to apply it to, they can instead take a skill proficiency with it. 

**Sprinting & Chasing** – you can spend your movement, action and bonus action (your entire “turn”) to move 5 times your speed in a mostly straight line (some small adjustmants allowed), provoking opportunity attacks as normal. Movement in 5e is “combat movement”, a sort of situationally aware movement, which is why when you run the numbers it seems slow. This sprint, then, is an all-out reckless sprint.

Meanwhile, chases and chasing another creature is a skill challenge and is not invalidated by the speed value of one creature being greater than another’s. Large speed differences can grant advantages/disadvantages to certain rolls or modify DC's, depending on how the player has their character interact with the chase, but otherwise a character's combat "Movement" value doesn't affect chases.

**Unstable Platform** – when shooting from an unstable platform, such as quicksand, the back of a moving mount (horse, broomstick etc) or when actively flying (i.e. not with the fly or levitate spells, or similar), you make ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks that have somatic components with disadvantage. This rule creates the feat “Mounted Archery”. See the Materium Existantiae Core Setting document for details. 

**First Level Features*** – With your background feat you could choose to take as your feat (instead of from the normal and expanded feat lists) one of the class features listed below but using the prerequisites; 

Class | Feature | Prerequisite
---|---|---
Barbarian | Unarmored Defense (Barbarian) | Constitution 13
Fighter | Fighting Style | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13
Fighter | Second Wind | Constitution 13
Monk | Unarmored Defense (Monk)| Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
Paladin | Divine Sense | Wisdom 13 and religion proficiency
Paladin | Lay on Hands | Charisma 13 and religion proficiency
Revised Ranger | Favored Enemy | none
Rogue | Expertise I | Intelligence 13
Rogue | Thieves Cant | Charisma 13
Wizard | Arcane Recovery | Intelligence 13

## Pete's Edition of Dungeons & Dragons (PEDD)
(A remake of 5e)

If I were to make a radical 6e of a fashion that suited my tastes and mechanical areas to explore, reformulate and refine, while keeping as much as I could, this would be that. Starting with just the content of the player handbook, PEDD seeks to apply three major changes: abolishment of the class and levelling system (including updates to nearly all features, feats and spells), a rework of the character creation system and ability score system to be easier for new players and more sensible, and a rework of the action economy and combat to make it snappier yet more tactical. 

Anything not mentioned is not changed as while this is a total homebrew makeover the base is still D&D 5e and you know what, that’s OK. It's a good base, and one we are all familiar with, and extension means no need to repeat good material. It's all already there.

The following is the first forays into that.

### Character Creation Rework

#### *Ability Statistics*

The modifier into score system is a vestige. It is removed. All characters have ability statistics, a.k.a. "Stats", a single value from -5 to +5 (or more, for monsters). When creating characters, any ability score increase features are remapped to two +1's in the stated abilities. Any base-races/subraces with 3 or more abilities increased increase 3 statistics by +1. Humans (which in PEDD are the "Human+" from the homebrew above) can choose +1 to any three statistics.

The base statistics of a character are [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3]. Alternatively dice rollers can roll 6(d6-3), record each value and increase one value of their choice by one.

#### *Resistances and Statistics*
A line is drawn between your active statistics, and your passive resistances.

There are six statistics (note the changes):
- **Strength** - used in melee attacks, and feats of brawn
- **Accuracy** - used in ranged attacks, and feats of precision
- **Dexterity** - used in many skills, for feats of action
- **Intelligence** - used in knowledge and understanding, for feats of alacrity
- **Perception** - used to sense the world, spot hidden things, read others and see far
- **Charisma** - used to affect others through force of personality

And three resistances (used in saves):
- **Constitution** - the ability of the body to throw off ills
- **Reflexes** - the ability of the body to avoid harms
- **Willpower** - the ability of the mind to resist

Each Race and Background has a "Resistance Profile", where your final resistance values are the combination of the two. For example, Elves have a Constitution of -1, and Soldier's a Constitution of +3, meaning an Elf Protector starts with a Constitution of +2.

For those hankering for a sense of “wise” there is the Learned Power for wisdom in the sense of knowledgable, and the “Wisened” background that is wisdom in the sense of a wide body of practiced wisdom coming from aged experienced, the non-academic sage. 

**Initiative** - incidentally initiative is calculated from Dexterity + Perception as a base, with certain Powers affecting it further.

#### *Proficiency Bonuses and Expertise*
**Bonus** - Proficiency Bonus is simply "Bonus", which means +2, and is typically derived from Proficiency and Powers, a characters skill in an area. Having "proficiency" in a tool or skill means gaining a Bonus to rolls made with that tool/skill.

A Power, “Aptitude I/II”, increases that to +3/+4. Bonus applies to more than just proficiencies, many Powers now key off it explicitly. That being said any reference to being “Proficient” still means having a Bonus. 

**Expertise** - Abilities with Bonus can gain Expertise to be grant effectively a double Bonus. Every area of the game that grants Expertise should only do so when that area already has a Bonus, otherwise it is treated as a Bonus. An area of the game which already benefits from Expertise cannot benefit from it again.

### Combat Rework
The goal is to make combat more consistently dangerous: low level combat was too dangerous but quickly combat became trivial, characters were health sponges that you end up playing whack-a-mole with.

- Health progression starts higher and progresses in smaller steps naturally due to only being increased through Powers (no levels after all).
- Damage is also “brought in line”. 15 damage is enough to one shot a peasant, 30 an adventurer. All damage sources need to be recalibrated; various high-level spells and large monsters are brought down, melee attacks should be ok as they stand. Two sword strikes, a fireball, or a headshot (e.g. a critical) will kill you.
- The Defence rework makes it more likely for a character to be hit if they do nothing (lower base, active shielding etc), but through equipment (armour), defence boosting powers (Int/Will/Per) and action (parry/dodge/block) defence can be actively boosted for smart application allowing for higher average applied defence than old AC. 

Another goal is to make combat snappier. This lead to "One Action All At Once".

Also, if 5e made the math linear, PEDD seeks to make the math flat (as part of removing classes): with the following assumptions;
- "peasants" face an average dc of 10, hit at +0/+3 (unskilled, skilled, unskilled being the norm), have 10 defence and have 8-12 health. 
- "adventurers" face an average dc of 15, hit at +2/+5 (unskilled, skilled, skilled being the norm), have 15 defence, and have 20-30 health. 

#### *Health & Recovery*
**Health** - HP is relabelled to "Health", and is calculated from: racial “Baseline Health” (a 4/6/8/10) + background bonus (another 4/6/8/10) + Constitution (physical fortitude) + Willpower (mental fortitude). Health is explicitely a combination of physical and emotional wear and tear as well as the idea of "experience" that allows you to avoid, roll with and carry on from blows.

**Recovery** - Hit Dice are also an older mechanic that is mostly vestigal. It too is removed. Resting (short or long) recovers your Baseline Health, until your Health is back at its maximum. Long rests also only recover your Baseline Health, but are otherwise unchanged.

Once you have regained health from a short rest, you cannot regain health again until you have completed a long rest. 

That means, at a maximum, you can gain your Baseline Health (without modification from Powers) twice, once from a short rest and once from a long rest, per day. If you seek medical attention or healing spells, however, you may yet recover a lot more Health in a day.

#### *Wounds*
"Wounded X" is a new condition. When your Health is reduced to 0 or below for the first time in a fight, you go Unconsciouss and you gain the Wounded 1 condition. Each time you go down, your Wounded condition increases by one. When you make Death Saves, the DC is instead your Wounded condition value x5, so at Wounded I Death Saves are made against a DC of 5.

The wounded condition loses one rank per long rest, and one rank per successful Medicine DC Wounded rank x5 check. This Medicine check can be made once per day on a character. (My own Injury Risk is updated to use Wounded X to calculate Injury Risk).

#### *Defence, Armour and Evasion*
AC is recalculated and relabelled to "Defence".

The Defence Stat is more flexible and is made of three parts: a base value of 8, an Armour value and an Evasion value. By default Evasion is Dexterity to a minimum of 0, but Armour can limit it to a maximum (noted in the armour). This gives us three kinds of Defence. Normal Defence, and:

- **Unarmoured Defense** - Defence without Armour, armour limits on Dexterity are still applied

- **Stationary Defense** - Defence without Evasion, often called "touch AC" in other systems

#### *One Action All At Once*
A major change I've experimented a little with is a radical change where, simply, all characters in a round of combat have one action, and everyone "acts" at once, no initiative.

All enemies in the scene declare their intentions, just as their movements would give away what they're about to do. Then all players decide among themselves what they're going to do that round.

For any situations where the order of actions matters, the two characters involved roll of with initiative, or for "slow" enemies / mooks the GM will just let the players go first.

Most actions, however, can be resolved simultaneously. Attacks for example; two people just try to hit each other, damage each other, and collapse wounded at the same time.

For smaller groups (that is, of players & enemies) it worked quite well. We'll see with larger groups.

Since everyone gets only one action, the action bonus-action movement economy of 5e is radically changed.

Movement is simply another action. Bonus actions are revamped, and any bonus-action can be "promoted" to an action, if a characters wants to do two bonus actions in a round. Reactions, interestingly, disappear.

Also, to make martial combat spicier a variety of generally available tactical basic combat actions are added; 
- **Charge** - a linear move that allows 1 attack at advantage as a bonus action
- **Dodge** - as an action to being attacked, make a dexterity save throw and if the result is higher than your Defense, it replaces your defence value for the rest of the round
- **Block** - as a bonus action, raise your weapon or shield to gain the block value as Armour to your defence. This prevents you using that item as a weapon to attack. Both effects last for the rest of the round
- **Parry** - if your weapon has the parry property, as an action to being attacked in melee, make an attack action. The roll is your Defense for the rest of this round, and also functions as a normal attack action
- **Step** - as a bonus action, move 5ft without triggering attacks of opportunity
- **Stand** - a bonus action. 
- **Go to cover / Go prone** - as a bonus action make yourself Prone, or enter adjacent cover. The Prone condition or being in cover uses Stationary Defence. As before prone makes being shot at occur at disadvantage, and cover is +2/+5 to Defence for half / ¾ cover.
- **Disengage** is a bonus action for anyone
- **Attack of Opportunity** - as a bonus action to an enemy you're engaged with moving away from you without Disengaging from you, you can make an attack action on them 

#### *Engagement*
To help with handling fights with little to no initiative, combatants are "paired off". These are the momentary pairs or small groups that naturally form in the middle of any chaotic fight, and allows us as the players to "zoom in" on little microcosms of fights with the camera focusing on pairing after pairing.

Engagements are resolved effectively simultaneously and the order of engagements doesn’t matter. With only 1 action per turn melees can’t effect each other. In cases where order of action is important characters “roll off” using their initiative. 

All combat is resolved in two simple steps:

1. **Determine Engagements** - where combatents “pair off”. “Pulling” and “turning” if in conflict are rolled off. Any who intend to move do, engaging if necessary.
2. **Resolve Engagements** - resolving pairs/groups in a sensible/cinematic sequence. Melee conflicts are easily resolved. Ranged attacks naturally involve unpaired individuals; resolve simultaneously with everyone else. Resolve conflicts of interest with a roll off like normal (I try to grab the bag of gold before him, for example). 

If it makes sense to resolve conflicts of interest using appropriate skill checks rather than Initiative (i.e. speed), then do so.

**Zone of Engagement** – the rules of pairing off, pulling and turning. 

How do you avoid a long conga-line chain of awkwardly connected characters fighting each other? "Pairing off", where a character can only be engaged by a number of characters equal to their size (1 for tiny/small, 2 for medium, 4 for large, 8 for gargantuan). A character can only attempt to engage one character at a time. You can only melee attack someone you’re engaged with. Being next to someone who is already fully engaged is “crowding” giving all attackers disadvantage. Conga-lines break; if you who are engaging someone who is engaging someone else are engaged by a fourth, you must “turn” and engage your attacker, with the attacker “pulling”. I.e., you cannot be "pulled" if you are engaged with someone who is engaged with you.

**Flanking** works by being the one in an engagement who the foe isn’t engaging. Though, like my original homebrew, you cannot flank a creature 2 or more sizes larger than you.

### Class & Levelling Rework
An abolishment of all classes and the system of levelling, replaced with "Powers" (created from Features and Feats) with a more story-driven Power by Power development system.

Progression, then, is the acquisition of more Powers and proficiencies. Certain Powers will be stronger than others, so they will key off of prerequisites, typically Stats, other powers and also “After n or more Powers”, or "Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power". These are noted in brackets before the description of the Power.

"Once every n<sup>th</sup> Power" means n number of other Powers must be taken before this Power can be taken, and the same again if taking this power again. This has nothing to do with other Powers that also have this prerequisite, so they may be "interleaved".

Powers taken more than once should be noted what "Rank" they are at; such as "Hale I" or "Hale IV", to show that they are technically two separate powers.

This means (as both Hearty and Hale are "Once every 2<sup>nd</sup> Power" Powers) the following is a valid combination of Powers:
1. Brawler
2. Hearty I
3. Hale I
4. Hearty II
5. Hale II

Powers have some meta categories:
- Innate Powers – cannot be trained in normal progression
- Unique Powers - can only be taken once
- Difficult - Powers that take longer than usual to learn

Powers are “in training” before coming online, to encourage roleplay of skill acquisition. E.g. a character at the start of each session declares what Power/s they are training towards and when the when the group / DM feels its appropriate, characters gain that Power.

For the intended "power level" of a Power, take any Feat from the PHB which has a Stat increase component, and remove the Stat increase.

Spellcasting is a Feature that has had to receive major reworking, and is still WIP.

#### *Example Powers*
**Artisan** – gain proficiency in a Tool Set and proficiency in a Skill. You also gain Expertise in a Tool Set. When not at Disadvantage, you can choose to not roll when making any Tool Set check and instead assume you rolled a 10, adding Stat and any Bonus to that as normal.

**Brawler** – (Unique) Your Unarmed Attacks contain the Block I, Finesse and Parry (bludgeoning) properties. Your Unarmed Attacks deal d4 damage.

**Combat Expert** – (Proficiency with a martial weapon) You can Engage one more enemy, up to the maximum number possible for your Size

**Hale** – (Once per 2 Powers) Rests grant an additional Constitution + Willpower (to a minimum of 1) as well to Health recovery.

**Hardy** - (Once per 2 Powers) Add your Constitution & Willpower (to a minimum of 1) to your Health total

**Hunter** – (Unique) You can Aim as a bonus action, granting a Bonus to the next Ranged Weapon Attack you make this turn.

**Innate Spells** – (Spellcasting Initiate I), learn two spells from your known spell lists. You cannot learn spells of a Circle you cannot yet cast.

**Learned** power – gain expertise in history, arcana or religion.

**Magical Reserve** Power – determines spell slots. “Once Every 2nd Power”. Progression down the old spell slot table but with relabelled terms; spell casts, magnitude. Explicitly state all higher magnitude casts can be “down cast”, and that certain spells can be “Up Cast” as described in their spell description.

**Protector** – (Unique) You can make the Block action with Shields as a Bonus action. You can instead block for an ally within 5ft of you. They gain the benefits of the block as if they themselves blocked.

**Quick Recovery** – when Resting regain Baseline Health x2 Health. Can be taken again for x3 after 5 or more Powers, then finally once more for x4 affect after 10 or more Powers.

**Resistance Increase** – (Once every 5<sup>th</sup> Power), increase a Resistance by +2

**Run and Gun** – (Unique) you can Run and Gun as an action, where you can make a ranged weapon attack at disadvantage after making a move action as a bonus action. You may instead fire and then move.

**Spellcasting Initiate** – choose a Sphere of Magic: Arcane, Divine, Occult or Primal. You gain 2 cantrips and a 1st Circle spell from that list. You also gain the Spellcasting Power for that Sphere. You can take this Power again if you can and do choose a different Sphere of Magic.

**Stat Increase** – (Once every 5<sup>th</sup> Power), increase a Statistic by +1
