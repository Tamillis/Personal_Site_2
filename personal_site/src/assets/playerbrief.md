I run D&D pretty much everywhere I go, as it's one of my favourite and deepest passions. A table-top roleplaying game is unlike anything else, a piece of live theatre, boardgame, and creative co-operative story telling all in one. I never can find the words to describe it properly.

I've been running it for over 10 years since I was 16, and by far the most popular system at my tables has been Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. My grandest of world building projects, also visible on this site, is my go to setting for it, and itself was built around the assumed setting that D&D functions around.

For players in my games, this page is a starting point of any campaign for them to dig into the slight changes I often use, and for any visitors I hope it can give you ideas and perhaps even introduce you to some new and exciting content. While I use the base game mostly as is, I have this following collection of homebrew that I have curated from the internet or on occasion come up with myself.

## Master Player Brief 

This is the master brief, the default applicable rules I run on top of D&D 5th Edition, regardless of setting. Some setting specific modifications may be made, and I would tell you about those. 

### Official Material I run: 

All D&D 5e official WoTC printed books, including those that come out in the future (PHB, SCAG, Xanathar's, etc). I run Unearthed Arcana material on an open trial basis, where I retain the right to modify or remove UA material if it becomes an issue. With regards to the Class Variant Features UA the ‘Spell Versatility’ features are not allowed, as they break my in-universe laws of magic. UA that is considered retired, such as those since the release of Tasha’s, I don’t allow by default (though as usual you can ask).

If there's something from 3rd Party, or Homebrew you desperately want please run it by me first. I'm not just going to say no.

### Homebrew I run: 

The following collection of vetted-by-me homebrew (subject to oversight and at-the-table balancing). The only homebrew that replaces default rules is Weapons Revised, which provides a more balanced, nuanced and slight power up to weapons and weapon users, so please at least skim it. It is marked with an asterisk *.  

The compendiums are high-quality compilations of whole swathes of options in the style of Xanathar’s, and I do recommend taking a peek if you want to try something new or are looking for novel character ideas. I also would love to playtest them, so there’s that too.

### Personal Homebrew  

*Armouries of the Second Empire* – should we be playing in the Age of Man setting, or something similar, the following are a list of firearms, firearms rules, and items from the Second Empire; 

https://1drv.ms/w/s!Aq2B34oritBLnj8-HQVw6hqZGfYc?e=YTcIEA 

*Dryad Prestige Class* – it is a work in progress, but needs testing to find the feel of it. Characters who have had their soul bonded to a tree by a powerful fey start to become dryads, and as they indulge in their new nature, they grow into the powers described within. This is a "Prestige Class" that only goes up to level 10 and is intended to be taken through multiclassing. You may take dryad as your first level, perhaps that is indeed how your adventuring career started.

*Magus* - WIP, mostly done (bother me if you want to playtest early)

*Potion Maker* - very much a WIP

### Personal Homebrew Rules 
We will be playing with all the optional rules we all take for granted, like feats, background variants, multiclassing and flanking. In addition, we will play with my personal homebrew rules, a list of small rules tweaks and additions. Rules marked with an asterisk * are important to normal character creation; 

*Accessing Bags and Items *– accessing any bags, packs, or items not stored in purposefully easily accessible locations, such as a purpose-built pocket, a bandoleer, a holster, or a sheath (or so on), is an action, as you take off a bag, rummage around in it, withdraw the item, and put the bag back on (or equivalent). Such items, in particular potions of healing, do not fit in normal pockets, though certain custom-made holsters may do the trick. Accessing any items in purposefully easily accessible locations like this is instead a bonus action.  

The act of consuming or administering any potion/poison/etc., like normal drinking, is considered part of the action / bonus action. Items that are used as an action, such as a medical kit or trap, are not accessed as part of their use action, so be prepared. 

*Background Feat & Normal+ Humans** – you pick one feat at character creation, as if you have a character level of 1 (but otherwise classless), in addition to normal character creation. However, this feat must be related to your background, such as Skulker for the Criminal background. This can be any available feat as allowed by the core or expanded rules, such as the features come feats in the table below. Because of this, the *Variant Human* and *Custom Lineage* are not available. Instead you may choose a "Normal Human+", using the non-variant human plus an additional Skill Proficiency of your choice and an additional Tool Proficiency of your choice, and just as always, you can be the statistics of a race while skinning it as something else.

*Cultural Languages** – There are no racial languages, but cultural languages in their stead, such as Imperial Common. Characters grow up speaking their culture's language, and the setting’s Common if their home culture is not that. Additional ‘racial’ languages are instead additional cultural languages. Knowledge of language comes from culture and nurture, not from blood. That said, exotic languages (such as draconic) are considered an aspect of magic, and (like normal) may not be taken as a ‘racial’ language without DM consent. See the 'Languages' section of the setting for details and the various cultural languages. 

*No Colossal Flanking* – Flanking cannot be earned on creatures two or more sizes larger than you. 

*Flanking, theatre of the mind* – when engaging a creature in melee you are said to be ‘facing’ that creature. When attacking a creature in melee who is not facing you, you gain advantage due to flanking. Creatures not already engaged automatically ‘face’ the incoming attacker. At the end of the turn creatures declare who they face until the start of their next turn, if not immediately obvious. Players with the *Extra Attack* feature and creatures with *Multi-attack* can face a number of creatures at once equal to their total number of attacks (effectively requiring a number of attackers equal to the number of their attacks for an additional attacker to gain advantage from flanking). Note that only the creature/s not being faced gain advantage.

*Hitting Cover* – Ranged attacks against creatures in cover hit the cover if the player rolls the cover value or below on the dice (so 1-2 for half cover and 1-5 in three quarter cover). Creatures in 5ft with creatures of their size or larger are treated as being in half cover (+2 bonus to AC) by their enemy, meaning creatures in melee provide cover for each other. Creatures in 5ft with creatures two sizes larger (or bigger) are in three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC). Don’t shoot your allies now!  

*Improved Standard Array* – we will be using my version of the standard array. I find the original a little underwhelming for Heroic Adventuring, and also poorly balanced between odd and even values. So, we will use; 
16, 14, 13, 11, 10, 9 
This array also modifies the total points for those using Point Buy to 30. Feel free to use the calculator below to help you out if using Point Buy instead.

*Injury Risk* – when a character goes unconscious in a fight, next to their death saves, they tally a mark, an "injury risk". At the end of the fight characters that have injury risks make a constitution saving throw vs a DC equal to the number of risks x5 (so one risk is a DC 5, two risks DC 10, etc.) and erase the marks. If they fail, their temporary harms develop into a permanent injury, and they roll on the injury table found on page 272 of the DMG, otherwise the risk abates and they suffered only temporary wounds. Depending on the injury, the DM in collaboration with the players may adjudicate a different permanent injury. 

*Skill Per Intelligence** – intelligence is one of the weakest statistics mechanically, leading many to take it as a dump statistic and shoe-horning their character to be played as a dumbass (though sometimes this can be fun, no mistake, it should be a choice not a compromise). In an attempt to reconnect Intelligence to Skills, their old domain, and boost its worth; when creating a character, you select a number of skills from your class’ skill list equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier (to a total minimum of 0), not the number stated.  

In the unlikely situation where high level characters find themselves with the *Expertise* feature and no skills to apply it to, they can instead take a skill proficiency with it. 

*Sprinting & Chasing* – you can spend your movement, action and bonus action (your entire “turn”) to move 5 times your speed in a mostly straight line (some small adjustmants allowed), provoking opportunity attacks as normal. Movement in 5e is “combat movement”, a sort of situationally aware movement, which is why when you run the numbers it seems slow. This sprint, then, is an all-out reckless sprint.

Meanwhile, chases and chasing another creature is a skill challenge and is not invalidated by the speed value of one creature being greater than another’s. Large speed differences can grant advantages/disadvantages to certain rolls or modify DC's, depending on how the player has their character interact with the chase, but otherwise a character's combat "Movement" value doesn't affect chases.

*Unstable Platform* – when shooting from an unstable platform, such as quicksand, the back of a moving mount (horse, broomstick etc) or when actively flying (i.e. not with the fly or levitate spells, or similar), you make ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks that have somatic components with disadvantage. This rule creates the feat “Mounted Archery”. See the Materium Existantiae Core Setting document for details. 

***
