# The Home Constellations

## CAUTION, THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND CONTAINS GAME SPOILERS AND NON-DIEGETIC CONTENT

> "The world may have been reduced to a series of stepping stones, but as in life we go from place to place, so can a shattered world be just as complete and fulfilling as Eden whole" - Edvard Länsimarssi, an explorer-thinker of Nybor 

The Home Constellations are the collections of shards that are, relatively speaking of course, near to each other in the context of navigation of the Eternal Calm. Explorers talk of other shards beyond the conglomeration, reachable across the vast turbulant deeps and quiet toldrum shallows, but few traders and citizens of Empire venture there. The distance and danger is too great to be practical.

Below are descriptions of various individual shards found across the Home Constellations. Each and every shard has its own history, culture and story since the Shattering, and few have technological parity with the two great materiae, though many hold secrets and marvels of their own. Every Shard is ripe for exploration and rich in stories to find.

Some stories are yet set in different periods of times, so that one may explore the political and historical events most relevant for that Shard's time.

### The Greater and Lesser Materiae
Scholars divide shards into Greater and Lesser Materiae based simply on their size, for a Greater Materia is one whose size rivals that of continents. There are three known Greater Materiae in the Home Constellations and the current explored fabric of the Materium according to official imperial records. Two, Patrie du Pape and Mitteland, sustain the great civilizations of the 'Republic of White and Blue' and the 'Empire of Mitteland', respectively, which both lie on the axis of Vihreá. The other discovered Greater Materia is the relatively uncivilized Tlancayo, newly unveiled to the other two on the axis of Harmaa after explorers followed what they called the "Chain of Magellan", a legendary series of then difficult to navigate Shards that seemed to lead away from the Home Constellations only to unveil a third anchor, that of Tlancayo, and far more shards and constellations in the local cluster than initially thought.

The other "Lesser" Materiae are invariably smaller though by how much varies drastically, from the size of countries to that of a single estate, so-called 'micro-shards' or 'pocket-worlds', but otherwise they are often populated with some native peoples. Many of them were also colonised by one of the two great powers to some degree or other, during the ages.

### The Known Worlds
Extensive astral mapping has proven without doubt that each Greater Materia, Mitteland, Patrie du Pape and even Tlancayo, conducts a swirl of psychic weight several magnitudes greater than the pull of any normal shard, drawing and whisking the other shards around them.

The pull between the two relatively “close” Greater Materiae of Mitteland and Patrie du Pape has caught many shards in great eddies and whorls that make up the many named and unnamed constellations of the local psychic region: what navigators call the Local Cluster, but more romantically to both populations as "The Known Worlds". 

Public records note that of the some 200 shards of the Local Cluster: around 120 are ocean shards, though some bare islands, and 80 are land-bearing, of which half are recorded as 'dead shards' barren or near barren of life due to missing conditions, lack of light or water, or other more foul causes.
 
Official Imperial records (crimped Nyborian records) count 33 known living shards and the old Kingdom records stood at 28, though there's contains names not listed in the former's...

Of course this does not include the pocket worlds and slivers large enough to detect but too small to warrant investigation.

### The Constellations and Astral Navigation
The rough locations and distances of the Shards can be mapped to each other in what scholars call “astral miles”, but don’t be fooled into thinking that shards are simple distances from each other.

Centuries of study and exploration has yielded a map where Shards are measured against a projection of the Eternal Calm into two planes; terms coined in Nybor where the phenomenon was first observed; the axes Harmaa (grey) and Vihreá (green), one for each lunar anchor who over time have come to be called those same names. Such maps greatly resemble star charts, circling the green and grey anchors in their respective centres, and so clusters of mapped shards, and more importantly the strong connections between them, are assembled into so-called “constellations”. 

It’s often taught that the planes are two sides of one sheet, like a sheaf of paper, and though that is not quite the case in truth it is a useful approximation. At various “low points” the two projections can be said to almost intersect, where the paper gets so thin you can see the other side, and in a few regions they literally mix, though the psychic turbulence of such 'psychic orthogonal rapids', 'pores', actually makes approaching, let alone using one, very dangerous for all but the hardiest and swiftest of vessels and creatures. 

**Inversion** – these low points are useful for one very particular reason: for traversal from one half of the Eternal Calm to the other, in a process known as “Inversion”. Inversion capable ships journey to the various low, but otherwise none intersecting, locales and rotate upside down by inverting their anchor. Then, through adjustments of psychic balest, “buoy up” to the desired side. Without such a technique half the known worlds would never have been found.

**Astral Lanes** – The eddies and flows in the psychic pull of the Eternal calm creates a weblike map of trade winds, currents, rapids, turbulence and doldrums between the shards known as the “astral lanes”, with ships going along astral headings and at astral knots using the cardinal moons and too-bright stars. Venturing outside known lanes can leave captains adrift for years, or even drawn to worlds unknown. Constellation lines are more than pretty pictures to decorate the maps, they indicate these very Astral Lanes.

**Deeps of the Eternal Calm** – Between shards, and especially surrounding the edges of the Local Cluster, are the Deeps of the Eternal Calm, where its residents that are most anathema to the visitors from the physical realms often reside, and become yet another barrier against crossing the vast astral distances to other rumoured clusters.

**The Shallows of the Eternal Calm** – these are where the seas are particularly shallow and prone to beaching ships incapable of a swift psychic headwind. One's astral knots translate also into smoother sailing. Those that end up 'beached' leave souls stranded upon the pearlescent waves to wander lost and unable to feel the pull home. Unlike oceans of the materium, the waters of the calm are no such thing, and in the shallows a man can easily stride the surface as if it were shallow marsh, or sink into hidden psychic depths not even able to drown. These and other astral features, like the escarpment dredged out for Anchorage, and navigating them and their residents, are some of the Calm’s many dangers. 

**Psychic Storms** – another danger of the Eternal Calm is the weather. It does exist in a fashion, though it makes no waves. Squalls and fronts of accumulated emotion from those within the Calm and that which has blown through from the shards forms the occasional psychic storm. Weathering them is another of the dangers sailors must prepare for, often just by battening down the hatches, and tying themselves up.

**Astral North** – Navigators use the homeward pull and one of the two moons to get their bearing, with the Imperial Society of Navigators having created a standard “astral north” which they, and now most of the astral going polities of the cluster, use when creating charts. It takes training and special astral compasses or sextants to determine this north, but once found it is an invaluable aid to keeping ones heading and maintaining speed, lest one flounder and run into shallows.

**Tin Hats** - many navigators and their sailors where tin hats, made of a cheap but effective foil that provides no physical protection at all, but greatly reduces the pull of each individual on the psychic winds, and helps ships sail in the direction a navigator wishes.

**Up-Wells** - When transitioning back to the material captains need to navigate to astral high-points, where they catalyse and then ascend so-called Up-Wells, places in the astral topography close to the materiae that can be coaxed and ridden as a bridge back to the material world, briefly pulling the Mist into the Calm where they literally bridge cosmological points.

Anchorage’s use of sky hooks and similar temporary mistal portals are also used for transitioning, but far more rarely as it relies on technologies and geography shard-side. 

### Classification of Worlds
**Living Worlds** - All the worlds home to people belong to a classification scholars simply call “Living Worlds”. These are worlds then that have land, life and light, and enough of a territorial core that the Mists are held sufficiently at-bay with enough room that the dangers of the Mist (and in particular the things that come out of it) don’t effect an area that is then large enough to sustain civilisation, or at the very least life. The Sea Elves and other denizens of Atlanture, a fully water shard whose shallows and even depths host a rich civilisation, call these scholars "Terra-centric tits", apparently.

**Mist Worlds** – There is a limit where a certain shard that should be life bearing is too small or the mistal forces on it too great for its size, and the Mists dominate it. It might be that there are sections of the Shard that never once, at one point or other, have Mist roll over it, that there is a core of untouched land, but still that core is too close and the dangerous creatures and effects of the Mist still reach it. In effect, the entire shard is no-mans land. This may also only be temporary, but happens often enough that no civilisation or much life, even, exists on the shard. Any shard whose every surface was at some point or another under the Mists is doomed. These, then, are one kind of 'dead' world, known as “Mist Worlds”. What strides them is not life.

**Dark Worlds** – another cause of dead shards are simply those that, for one reason or another, never get light. Stuck in pure darkness, the life that was on the shard withers and dies. A very few “Dark Worlds” are yet life bearing, things from the underdark having colonised the shard. One such shard, “Umbria Minor”, lies astrologically close to Mitteland, and is a source of rare alchemical ingredients, so Mitteland maintains an alchemical expedition outpost there.

**Dry Worlds** – the flow of waters in and out of the Mists is a matter of intense study, but it seams that certain areas of the Mist are great sources of water, both liquid, nearly always salt water, and gaseous in the air. And some Mist walls will accept any and all water that flow into them, returning nothing. When such a Mist Wall encountered a shard’s sea, that sea drained. Evidence of drained seas of Eden can be seen many shards over. Some shards are unfortunate, in that their entire Mist Wall drains. In time, with very little gaseous water returning to even provide rain, the hydrosphere of a shard is drained dry. Inevitably, these desert worlds dwindle to all but the hardiest of life.

**Ocean Worlds** – Eden, it seems, was a majority watery place, at least on the surface. Theoretically it was an equal balance of earth, water, air and fire, but rock sinks, so only by the Creator’s grace did they mold the rock so that some of it stood above the waterline. Now, in the Shattered remains, many, many shards are simply huge patches of water with a rocky bottom. Such worlds may yet contain oceanic life, and often do, but to land-based civilisation, they hold little interest.

### Tlancayo
Tlancayo, like the other Greater Materiae, is a continent sized materium, stretching for hundreds of miles north-east to south-west, covered in steaming jungles, soaring mountains and vast plains of fertile highland and steppe-like lowland. The land divides two seas, the Gulf Sea and the Farsea, where mages find that warping to one is totally unlike warping to another, and the potential for further exploration is ripe on their tongues. A string of islands runs southwards in the Farsea, the greatest of which by far is the pirate haven of Deflaiga, a “free city” nest that runs on mob rule and pseudo-anarchy, long thought by them to simply be a sea shard with only their own small haven.

#### In the Age of Wonder, circa 1200 (tbc)
Discovered within the past two generations by the Kingdom of the Father, and soon after by the Empire, colonies were quickly established on the Verdant Sliver. The settled city of Neu Wachia was quickly settled by the imperials, and stands at the mouth of the Thousand Ribbons as a gateway to a new and green world. To the north is the Blue and White settlement of Bon Veil, founded longer ago but struggling in its environs and rulership, opens up the vast grasslands to similar adventurers. The second Blue and White settlement, Sanc de Lis, sits upon a major tributary river of the Thousand Ribbons and serves as the biggest settlement for Mist divers, as the surprisingly stable mists lie less than a hundred miles to the north. This new land is rich in resources, magics and mystery, and the two major powers already vie for dominance on this ribbon of green, their colonies practically carrying out a proxy war.

Tlancayo is dominated by three main environments. To the north is a vast plain of rolling hills and grass, with the occasional temperate forest and glade, stretching as far as the eye can see. Eventually it runs into a Mist Wall long and straight, unlike anything similar in either of the other Great Materia, and Mist divers, adventurers, and heroes alike, of both nations or simple freelancers, are eager for the treasures they may find. The northern most settlement of Gandermein’s Luck sits on the large freshwater lake Kepauche, whose far shore flickers deep in the Mist Wall.

The centre of the continent is covered in a vast tropical forest, from Gulf coast to the great line of the Stone Spine Mountains, and stretching from north to south for the Spine’s entire length. Warm moist air rises over Piccard’s Wall and drops its load before the mountains, and the shape of the land funnels the waters of nearly the entire jungle, through crags and gullies, around hills and rises, into the mighty River of a Thousand Ribbons. This great river, over 30 miles wide at its widest, empties out into the Gulf across a vast swampy delta. These jungles are dense, humid, and chock full with life, and primal magic pulses in the very roots of the trees. Many peoples call the forest home, and many cities and ruins, and legends, can be found within, including rumours of a city constructed entirely of gold.

To the south-west the land opens up again into a second plain of grasses, shrubbery and fertile slopes, curving northward towards the Black Rise and onwards to the Splinter Fingers. The Shrine of Tzi Huatla lies on the salty lake of the same name, and is the end point of two rivers before the Salt Dunes. This desert is absolutely dry, and much of the sand that makes its dunes is actually salt. Unable to evaporate heat, the energy is trapped in the white sands, rising local temperatures to unbearable heights. The Mist Wall looms at the deserts edge, to form a true hellscape. Not even the most reckless divers bother with those mists, as the sands make them all but unapproachable. And yet, for those same reasons, it holds a potentially untapped wealth of artefacts and treasures within.

Umbre is a city state of native peoples that has weathered existence for several thousand years, and its strange and alien cultures of body sculpting magic, ritualised blood sports and mask wearing are often difficult to grasp for outsiders, but one thing is clear. Umbre endures. Only its locals have the skills necessary to scale the Black Rise, or venture into the Salt Dunes.

Neu Wachia is the city the Empire has founded in Tlancayo, right on a hard rock outcrop in the delta of the Thousand Ribbons River. It began as Catteget’s Post, a defensive position that made use of the strategic position of the outcrop. Since then it has spread out to cover many of the sturdier isles and islets that make up the eastern third of the delta. Nearby districts and towns have sprung up on the further channels, and on banks of both sides of the delta, connected by strings of floating bridges, ferries, and fords. The island a few miles to the east has been taken over by the Empire’s world renowned magic guild-come-university, the Biblias Magikum. There they research and search after artefacts and other magical items they’ve discovered in this land.

Bon Veil is the first colony of the Kingdom of White and Blue, outdating Neu Wachia by more than 30 years, and is the trade port which leads to the farming settlement and resource hub of Sanc de Lis. This second settlement now outsizes Bon Veil, which is strangled by poor soils and lack of readily available fresh water. However the Holy Father has ordered the construction of a long and complex aqueduct from the northern Piccard’s Wall hills to the town, which should significantly boost the economy and prosperity of the town. The tribes of the area, however, are less than pleased. The good people of the town couldn’t really care less.

#### In the Age of Man - TODO
Biopunk Aztec resurgence state centred around Umbre, or as it calls itself, the empire of the Tlantuyniyuq, vs a confederated imperial – patrie du pape survival colony coastal state of gulf coast settlements and bare few inland ones, with Sanc de Lis a smoking wreck, and more advanced pirates on the other side of the isthmus that are growing into a piratical military state who operate the Deflaiga Cruise across the Ithmus canal to “facilitate transportation” down the Thousand Ribbons.

The Tlantuyniyuq use advanced healing magic brought by the outside in combination with their old body morphing patronage from their yikesy gods, thkugh not evil, to allow grafting of any good parts of captured peoples onto their own parts (or criminals, as punishment etc of their own populace) including across racial bounds. [Simic hybrid or something better of my own design].

The Shards theme isn’t clear other than to be an example of my favouritr: conflict upon messy conflict. Internal disagreements of the confederation of colonies. Tlantuyniyuq vs confederation. Former colonies vs their returned colonial masters. The two colonial masters against each other. Pirates along the river ruining everyones lives. Unaffiluated tribes of the jungles pushed to war-like responses.

And no one remembers the obsidian dwarves.

### The Shard of Great Plains and Lakes - TODO
Native American & “Protestant” Settler Shard

Settlers cut off early on by an astral storm. 75% men. Smallpoxalypse never happened here, so the might of the federations and tribal nations, alongside fringe castle-ed up peoples like olmecs and pueblos (cos mists scarey yo), against the up-teched womenless outsiders set the stage. 

And yetis & peace pipes etc. 

Protestant in this case means early imperial adopters of the Everlight with patrie du pape renegades making a canadian esque blend. Isolation and entrenchment has produced a very us vs. them religion. 

### The Shard of Forgotten Rage
A shard occupied only by a peaceful orcish society, who’ve forgotten their rage, instead of overcoming it. Seeing other races brings it back, and they’re unused to controlling it. 

The rage was seen as a rare defensive reaction to threats, as whilst no other race calls the shard home (for reasons forgotten), it still has its fair share of monsters and invasive creatures, especially the local drow, who find these orcs fine catches and good for their blood sports. Conversely, these orcs saw the rage as something to lean into to protect themselves, until one day mistral ships appeared from the sea, and the non-orcs aboard triggered them. Thus begins a tragic campaign against perceived madness on one side and perceived demons on the other, with a powerful forgotten curse halting attempts at communication. 

### Tithesian - the Gradient Shard
The whole shard is on a gradient, topside is covered in tall mountains blanketed in perpetual snow. Downside is a sand dune sea of blistering heat. Between the two main rivers tumble their way down, evaporating from the great Oasis. Two great cultures fight a bitter and nigh neverending war of reason vs passion. The furfolk (tabaxi, centaur, minotaurs and shifters) vs the scaled folk (Lizardmen and Yuan-Ti).

Over the ages the methodical march of the Imperial Scale is beaten back by fur tides, and the cycle repeats. 

Be inspired by Mesopotamia. 

Imperial Hook: the NACA funds an expedition to explore this exotic shard for alien artefacts and unique magic.

### Roost
A shard of Bahamut the Platinum and his Shining Court, and the mortals that serve them.

Nevertheless, this is not a shard without its own troubles. Primarily, that the expeditions to other shards of the Metallic dragons, to accost those abusing the Edict and the Runes, keep opening holes in the Mistwall and inviting danger in, and that their absolute rule over what are essentially servile mortals chafes them after a hundred generations, as slowly but surely humans outnumber dragonborn, and dragon avarice asserts itself. An overly righteous inquisition faction vs a morally grey underground of resistance.

### Umbria Minor
A shard that lives, and yet is in eternal darkness. Underdark fauna and flora have colonised its surface and are a source of dim bioluminescence and what little food there naturally is, alongside the light-less seas. Now the shard is a source of rare materials and alchemical ingredients for the Empire of Mitteland who maintains an outpost (that did not have a fun time during the Strife) here.

### Atlanture
A few atolls and isles speckle this Ocean World, but the vast sunlit reefs are host to a huge variety of life and civilisation. Both Patrie du Pape and Mitteland maintain island-based way stations for this Shard that is astrologically between them both, but it is the Mermen, Sea Elves and Triton that rule here and without the Sea Power to project their interests, both Empires mostly make use of privateers of the locals that they can sway to their side.

### Teorzed
This desert shard, with its northern Sand Sea, dry and craggy Yagh mountains and the vast southern Hunavaas savannah, is a middle-east / central Africa inspired shard. Sinbad and Laurence of Arabia style adventures in the Serengeti can be had, replete with ancient ruins, huge animals and big-game hunters, set to a political backdrop of gold-resplendent city states and big foreign colonial powers meddling in native affairs with wandering nomadic tribes with lost knowledge (a la black panther, only pre-edict artefacts and bloodline magic).

The Sand Sea is made of fines, grains of sand so fine they act like water, allowing vessels to float and ply across them. Several rivers of fines also flow into the sea, connecting much of the lands, and many settlements dot the northern side of the mountain to make use of it.

Water is precious here, even in the Hunavaas, the Great Savannah, during the dry season. It oft makes an appearance as a sort of currency by way of standard clay pitchers of water called R’tawe. The only significant bodies of permanent water are; the Aieroet Kif (the largest river by far, and the only permanently flowing one, though at the end of the dry season it too is barely a trickle further upstream), the Oasis at Sisieëwo and the small landlocked sea of Kieël. The northern city of Ilopirt survives thanks to its extensive aqueduct system linked to the Endless Well in its primary temple. 

The locals speak a sort of clipped tongue called Komaans, a partial creole fusion of the various languages from the Empire, Nybor, Kingdom, and other minor colonial powers that have stepped on the natives’ toes in recent years. Recent conflicts back home have caused them to slump and the local powers to reassert authority, most of whom speak Nomoq. 

Lying in the north of the shard Teorzed, in an escarpment north of the Yagh Mountains, is the township of Asem. The township itself is primarily situated in the bowl of a collapsed mesa, whose surrounding rock walls make for both a natural harbour from sandstorms, and fantastic natural defences from pirates and deadly beasts. The township is home to many an opportunist, hunter and sailor, seeking to find treasure and glory beyond their natural harbour, and the services and administration that support them. The view is dominated by the desert, stretching as far north, east and west as the eye can see. Though utterly barren seeming, this desert is saturated with mana and all sorts of dangerous and exotic creatures call it home. The desert itself is primarily composed of a Sea of Fines in which ships, often magically reinforced, can literally sail, with islands and reefs of Roughs, and archipelagos of rocks and mesas.

The Deep Fines are so saturated with mana they can be sifted for crystals, a natural source of powdered mana crystals with both soporific and hallucinogenic properties that greatly enhance divination. The sale of which fuels all the economy of the north of Toerzed. Even though the product itself is dangerous if mishandled, the terrifying creatures large quantities attract, and the terrifying greed, are what will get you. The Small Particulate Iridium Crystal Extract must flow. 

#### Around 1200 A.C.
In the year 1200A.C. the major powers, the Empire and the Kingdom, are in the midsts of the Age of Strife and their various colonies are essentially left to their own devices, with colonial towns left to fend for themselves using only their own resources, and allowing native powers a chance to strike back, creating a more interesting power dynamic than just “imperials suppress natives” and more “so who’s going to dominate during this last chance before the imperials get their shit together and suppress the natives… again.” It also gives a new perspective on the Age of Strife from outside the collapsing Great Materiae.

Hooks:
- Too Much Spice – with the collapse of demand, spice has been over produced. Locals are over indulging, too many dangerous spice slingers (those granted sorcerous powers by spice) roam the streets, spice barons are struggling to maintain control after profits collapse, and great creatures are being lured out of the Fines to the over-full spice warehouses. Moving the spice away from the Fines just draws other creatures out of the other areas of the shard. What to do with all this Spice? Is the question our players must combat, as the right hand men of one particularly successful (until now), and thus particularly spice laden, Spice Baron.
- The Spice must flow – during a period of conflict and spice isn't flowing, a small guild is contracted with brining back a ship load. 

### Nybor, The Escarpment Maze & Anchorage
[The Hanseatic – Dutch – Viking Scandinavian inspired world soaring high above their Mist Walls, with some Finnish names sprinkled in]

The folk of this shard were a polity of loosely hegemonic city states, the greatest being that of Nyby (for which the people and place are named). The Nyborians invented the collection of enchantments necessary to warp through the mists. At first, they simply desired to dive into the many mistal canyons and inroads inherent to their cliff-side world a thousand fjords, creating diving bells of protected brass using enchanted ropes, learning how to properly shield against the warping chaos. Then they learned to utilize the Mists to find what they wanted. Eventually, they learned of the space-warping effect, and discovered the Eternal Calm and its wide still seas.

After finding the Eternal Calm, they then became adept at astral dredging and boatbuilding, first launching from huge lowering gantries fixed to the sides of their cliffs, from cities like Highharbour, Stenhaun, Neulantsmark and Skarburg, to building up and out their nearby shallows into the jointly owned and run Anchorage. Soon they were sailing to every nearby shard they could discover in their Calm’s nearby constellation. 

They had built a partly floating port on their side of the Eternal Calm to service the ships and sailors that had difficulty returned to cliff-side ports, especially those coming from elsewhere. They anchored it to a nearby Astral Reef, and called it Anchorage.

They made many an exploratory expedition, discovering a plethora of shards, occupied or otherwise. The sudden influx of access to raw goods and new buyers caused trade to flourish so extremely, much of the nyborian way of life bended to enable and support it; entire mistal canyons converting to docks and dry ports with corresponding ‘gantry lanes’ in Anchorage. They even developed ties with the Kingdom of White and Blue. 

Until one day a voyage took them to the loadstone of a new constellation, Mitteland. The tragedy of the traders was writ then, and the rest, as they say, is history. A few decades later, and increasing contact, saw the Empire invade, usurp Anchorage and soon Highharbour, and then through force and strong-arm diplomacy wrestle the majority of Nybor into Imperial hands, including having the temerity to add Nybor as a ducal title of their Empire.

The astral position of Nybor puts them at the binding point between the two (actually three) constellations that make up the local cluster, making them a rich but also strategic location. For this reason too the Empire invaded.

Of note is that they had already contacted the Kingdom before being taken over, and elements of the Nybor polities, and even the Imperial ANC, deal with them and the other shards still, especially the more rebellious and independent polities of Nybor and Nybor’s own colonies, and ultimately spread the technology of Warping that the Empire never really enjoyed a monopoly on.

Though the Empire would come to conquer the disparate city states of Nybor and make Anchorage their own, the political unification (forced or no) only saw the Nyborians grow stronger and travel further afield.

#### In the Age of Wonder
The folk, under nominal control of the Empire through the imperial established locally run Astral & Nyboria Company (TBC) but also privately serve the Kingdom of the Father, who run the warping vessels used to gain access to the Calm and other shards. A mix of nation and corporation. It is a more independent and multicultural fantasy East India Company.

#### In the Age of Man
The Age of Strife saw the ANC splinter into various trade and militant companies (blending the two into one indistinguishable practice) that loosely aligned with local city state factions, imperial loyalists and raw mercantile commercialists. During this stage the city of Anchorage grew out of proportion and gained its underbelly. Due to these internal politics the Duchy remained defacto part of the Empire, unlike many other colonies, but grew far more independent and inspired the political creation of Giuezzia within the Empire itself.

Imperial Hook: the ANC inheritor Empire Asset Traders wants a capable group to subdue an outlying town that has refused Imperial Tithe for a generation. 

#### Anchorage
The Eternal Calm dredged up and partially floating port city and stop off of Nybor, connecting to the shards via various skyhook ‘gantry lanes’ bell elevators and ship lifting cranes (though these days most are glorified elevators and only newly built ships are lowered rather than lifting vessels out for little gain). They correspond to the many cliffside ports of nybor. 

The non-static nature of the Mists makes such connections risky but they’ve long since mastered the art and generally speaking an elevator or skyhooked vessel goes where its meant to. 

The city is partitioned between the various old city state factions running ANC derived free companies (in both the trade and military sense);
- Highharbour’s Free Knights
- Stenhaun’s Brotherhood of Iron
- Neulantsmark’s Markedmen
- Skarburg’s Harlreikers
- Nyby’s Varangia
- ANC loyalists “Company Men”
- And Mercs

Also a noticeable Establishment of Tarentaise Traders and a Chapel of the Dawn, influences of the Republic the Underbelly, the part of the city that is the pre-existing astral reef on which it is anchored and literally underwater and occupied by mostly non-humans and astral denizens. 

The main port is the huge dock carved out of the shallows called the Cothon, its circular centre both iconic and serving as the royal skyhook downpoint. 

### The Shard of Ruins
A small shard dominated by an abandoned city overgrowing with foliage. Signs of death by starvation, plague and the slow depopulation of the few survivors. Sometimes life does not find a way. 

This quiet shard presents little in the way of overt challenge during the day, but the total lack of larger life and fairly pristine nature of seemingly random ruins (considering they’re implied to be standing for more than 1800 years / however many years since cataclysm) while other ruins are so lost and buried it’s like sections of the city have become ancient forest (because they have), is the inherent mystery. 

Characters can learn about the gathering of the initial survivors in a quarter of the ruined city, find the attempts to start cultivation with the few cultivatable plants that remained on this shard, and then the eventually split of the survivors. A few stayed on and starved to death, a few went on an expedition into the mistwall, and the rest committed mass suicide, tainting the small shard in black mana. 

When night falls the ghosts come out, mostly to tend to their ruined homes, but to pull down the larger plants and growths that “get in the way”, slay invasive animals, and to force anything sentient that visits to commit suicide (which explains the few more “recent” corpses that are found).

A few ancient artefacts can be found to sell, as well as a few gold and riches. Buried deep in an ancient temple is a shutdown Reforged who can be reactivated to tell the tale of 100 years alone in the ruins.

### Ninaven - very TODO
The shard of a culture completely designed in isolate from any real-world inspirations. The belief that all is fluid underpins the lands, degrees of solidarity, favouring water over the other elements, students of air (no solidness), students of steel (all solidness), those who roam vs those who grow vs those who raise walls vs those who fly. 

I think the name is just cool, nine havens. Nine islands of different sizes and locales on an otherwise watery shard.

### Patrie du Pape
[The second of the Great Materia. It is Latin Europe influenced, primarily France with Italian, Spanish & Dalmation touches] 

As a Shard it is dominated by a central fertile region (that also covers much of the south & south west), home to Tarentaise and many other cities and settlements, capped by a native northern mountain range and a giant crescent inland sea called the Sea of Bliss, la Mer de Bonheur, the land of its inner curve formed by the welling up from L’Alpes Blanches. 

**L’Alpes Blanches** – a huge tumbled mountain highland ovoid, from a minor shard that fell onto this one to form the northeast section of the shard. It holds back and channels the mists through a good third of its body, and over the millennia the out of favour peoples of Patrie du Pape have fled here including primarily Animalia and the Dwarves.
The huge mass of the addition gives the shard an easy to west slope. 

**Depression Lakes** – Name TBC. The many ripples in the land from the mountains falling above filled with water, making much of the inner curve of the Sea of Bliss also very watered. 

**Sea of Bliss** – the large north eastern inland sea that bows around L’Alpes Blanche. So named for its stillness. Barrier hills in the north east keep that mist wall away on the far side, as well as wrapping around the eastern to of the northern mountains to form a mountainous peninsula. 

**Western Stresses** – a series of huge crevasse rifts leading to the western expanse where the land was falling away into the void until it settled (although earthquakes and large shifts happen yearly, and earth elemental affinity is strong).
Western Expanse – where the land falls away and ths Mists lie hundreds of kilometres off, quite mysteriously. 

**Eastern Shores** - The only mistal “sea”, though the mists roll close enough to run over the shores regularly. A large part of which became the iron exclave (curtesy of an old mistal influx fiord), south of L’Alpes Blanches. These rocky shores were, and still often are, dangerous mistal nomanslands except since the birth of mistal going vessels and the start of Empire saw renewed interest in the region. Large and now ancient “brandhouses”, light house like structures, exist on various fingers of land holding the wrath of the mists back. The iron exclave’s fiord head fortress has brands engraved on the sea facing walls, protecting the entrance to the fiord and the still very fortress like city of Straas. 

Three main mist ending (Eastern Shores) rivers. 

#### Kingdom of the Father, Age of Wonder
A.K.A. the Kingdom of White and Blue. Human supremacists and Halfling monks and priesthood. A sort of two-caste theocratic dictatorship consequence of the fast friendship; where halflings see to the spiritual and humans the physical.

The people of White and Blue, with the motif coming from their well-recognised White and Blue Fleur de Lis iconography (the three forms of God, Senda Sendum and Sendus, seen to be the same, as one) on a round of white (the clergy) backed by blue (the working humans), are (in the Age of Wonder) or were (in the Age of Man) ruled by a Pope, a man or halfling (traditionally alternating) who passes his power onto an heir selected from the clergy, who is seen as the literal voice of God on Earth for the God of Man. This man, known as The Father, and his nation are sworn enemies of the Empire over a long history of rivalry, and formerly ever since the imperial invasion and the creation of the territory known as the Iron Exclave.

The doctrine of the Father, and their God the God of Man, places Humans & Halflings on a pedestal as paragons of right and proper people in the image of the First Men. In practice this is an excuse to exercise total domination on the other races, all of whom serve either as a downtrodden underclass (especially giant kin, who they see as the first traitors), or outright slaves. For is it not right that those whose prowess far outstrips others, should rule over them how they see fit. The fact that humans vastly outnumbered others at the outset of Patrie du Pape’s existence, is often glossed over. The way that they see it is as also their solemn and holy duty to rule also doesn’t help the outlook they hold in the eyes of others.

Patrie du Pape in the Age of Strife, the Shambling Tide
So many not zombies! Religious doubling down and reactionary atheism (not following / trusting old or new Gods) jostle to reform the nation while dealing with the aftermath. The Halfling role as stewards of religion, having already been steadily out populated by the human contingent, is displaced after much of their population fall to the shambling tide, the Drained. Many new orders turn them out as subhuman, and many atheistic groups turn on them for being the architects of the apocalypse. The natural tension of the religion snaps and Humans as the First Men are solidified in proper.

The Holy Orders vs Freeholders (holders of free thinking). Major Orders inc; Order of the Pure Rose, Order of Saint Herbert. Major Freeholder groups; the Illuminated, the Right Honourable Yeomanry of Ypres-san-fils. 

#### The Blue Republic, Age of Man
In the end The Kingdom of White and Blue's authoritarian theocratic Orders were overthrown by a popular revolution based in Tarentaise based on the writings of Freeholder F.M Erriate-Love in the Little Blue Book, the largest city on the continent, spawning the Republic of Patrie or better known as the “Blue Republic”. 

They were lead initially by their beloved Tyrant, who actually stepped down from power after a fifty-five-year conquest that saw the Republic asserting its dominance across Patrie. He died shortly after, beloved of his people, and his State Funeral lasted a week and saw crowds of such density and size never has their like been seen before or since. The Blue Republic is now ruled by the Government in Tarentaise, a democracy of locally elected or appointed representatives, that administrate all of the various departments, states and territories across Patrie and a few loyal shards. 

Or so was the tyrants plan. The fervour of rebellion has burned unchecked without his moderating and absolute power, and the guillotines bathed public squares in blood the Republic over, and halflings flee in terror no longer second class citizens but racial enemies of the New State. Now fanatics of a new and terrifying kind hold sway over the Republic, claiming a Third Glorious Republic, and their “tyranny” spawns fervour and terror. Some of which had started to spill over to Mitteland. 

### The Black Desert
The origin of the Velvet Ankh and home to those left behind. A shard whose water supply mostly disappeared (a few oases and duskdawn rivers) and whose rotation is so slow they have many month-long days and nights, baking in endless sun and freezing in endless night, or so it feels. 

### Terra Mysterialis
Not!Australia, home to the ram shackle city state of Sunkunder (was named Novalonia by Imam himself, but later generations renamed it) that was the Iron Fleet. For some raw jungle, desert and reef diving with life unlike any other. The shard itself is at the very edge of the Local Cluster, a footnote in old records and not visited in hundreds of years, though that might all change with the rediscovery of old royalty and certain other claims to the throne...

The Mautapo Reef – a vast shallow sea of underwater reefs, atolls, trenches full of mermen, sea elves and locathah that is half of the shard. 

Iron Mysteries – a campaign focused on finding the iron fleet. Maybe First Age. Go from capital to patre’s iron exclave to the shoal town of Duskberth Float in the Eternal Calm finally to Terra Mysterialis

### Cyclone, the Shard of Air and Earthen Bridge
This realm is an enormous vase-like bowl of Mist Wall, so named for the rotating whirlpool of Mists that are contained to a relatively tight band of fluctuation about the Sink of the Gods, down which it swirls. 

Contained within the bowl are huge outcrops and arcs of rock, stacked up chunks of land that fell into this sinkhole. Upon these the denizens of the shard make their nests and homes, soaring and flying through the sky or traversing the connecting vines, wary of falling in the sink themselves. The whole shard saturated with earth and wind magic, with heavy rocks floating on attuned winds, gusts throwing the unwary or il-tuned into the air, and new outcrops growing like roots of an invisible giant tree, ever able to replace rock that is lost to the slow corkscrew of the Mistwall.

Overhead above the neck of the Mists the sun shines down barely shifting, peering over the lip of the world in shining benevolence, sometimes obscured by thick Cloudnights, and rarely in Miststorms that bottle the shard entirely, a curiosity of its makeup that keeps it a mist-free bubble even without the shining sun. Sometimes the sky is lit by the dance of the Braid, that can weave its way perilously far down into the shard, as if drawn in.

The roots of the thick vines that dangle hundreds of meters from the towering rock contain the green-veins; a network of tunnels of secure passage, except the veins often flow in directions no vine goes, and one finds themselves on the cusp of the Wyld, until reappearing on an outcrop elsewhere within the Cyclone.

At the base the black sink roars, carrying the fallen, the trapped and the dead down to the Shadow. The thunder of the Mist-churned sea is so great any creature not deaf would soon become so.

### Anarsheim
The city state of Jatrheim, a primarily human city, is the hegemon of this minor Shard of Anarsheim. Of note is that it doesn't consider anyone a legal adult until they are at least 30 with one official deed (a deed being a thing of sufficiently viking-y importance) to their name, no matter their race. They have a caste of ogre thralls who, due to low intelligence and relatively short lives, are kept in essentially eternal bondage due to being unable to become “of age”. They’re also one of the few shards to independently master mistral travel, due mostly to the daring inspired by their deed culture cultivating an intense mist diving tradition. One thing led to another, and ways of warding against and subverting the mist led them to the Eternal Calm in relatively small vessels barely larger than rowboats, lead not by studied arcane navigators but by a steadily naturally cultivated substrain of Mistal Sorcerers capable of manipulating mist-stuff and penetrating through to the Eternal Calm, whereupon their charm and ego suited them well in psychic navigation, as opposed to the calm focus used elsewhere.

[Basically, pseudo-fantasy space viking pirates. Geographically inverted norway with mirrored sweden set west of it, the sea between them filled with longboats of course]

### La Ville En Défense
This village-come-shard near Patrie du Pápe is dominated by two facts: there is barely enough room to survive, with the village and its farms covering the entire (small) area of non-no-mans-lands, and the high ambient magic of this place that must be drained.

The central tower burns huge quantities of ambient mana. The village people are experts at Mist-diving, as most of their shard is no-mans-lands. They are also experts at magics for manipulating the Mist, ambient mana and population control. The village itself is more of one giant layered fortress [a lá Attack on Titan, but smaller scale and giant mist monsters and fuck tonnes of magic].

Hook: land on the shard by terrible accident, bringing word of an outside, and find a way back out and build a gate or some other mass transportation to get the shard away.
