**[Unknown] The Age of the Gods** – After the first being created the Great Wheel and became the Three, who formed the physical world during this age, the first Gods took their positions on the great stage. The fables and games of the Gods primarily took place during this time, as they discovered, roamed and sculpted the realms and each other. It ended with the founding of Eden and the shattering of the Three to sow the physical realm with mortal life. 

 

**[10,000 years of mystery] Pre-Cataclysm, The Age of Eden** – Little is known of this age, or its various stages, other than neither the Mists or the Edict were a thing and the Materiae were all one land without end. Gods would stride the land, the fey, shadow and planar realms were never too far away, and beings of all kinds would climb and fall in power and honour. Then, after an age of unimaginable length, great evil tore it all asunder. During this time many of the races came to be, through various acts or developments, and many of the ancient wars, retold only as myth, took part. Many Gods also came to be, ascending out of beings of power. The titans created their ordnung. The giants fought the dragons, and came to be secluded elemental beings. The various beast races and bloodlines came to be. The Legions of Terror ran rampant, checked only by crusade and Orange Army. The elves were cast out of the Fey Wild alongside the fall of Lolth. Ancient ruins and sealed powers still remain from these epic yet harrowing times. 

 

**[0AC] The Cataclysm** – Also called The Shattering. The world was torn asunder, literally ripping apart and the astral sea rushed in and frothed forth to take the form of The Mists. The miracles, civilizations, and peoples of the world were broken. As the shards settled, and the survivors unearthed themselves from their hiding places, they took stock of an entirely new world. The Gods had woven The Edict, that no mortal soul may ever wield such raw powers again and no good catalyse such destruction, the only instance when the six point star ever folded itself to agree on a single wish. That the Words of creation may never again be called readily to head. It was sealed with the War of the Dragons and The Edict. By the time the cataclysm was over, most had lost all, and a new era had begun.

**After Cataclysm (AC)** - where history diverges for each shard. Many start counting from the new reign of their Kings and leaders, but there can be quite the gap between the two events

## The History of the Home Constellation 

**[0AC – 900AC] The Age of Settlement** – the various polities that would dominate each shard, the fractured remains of the material realm, gradually take shape. The relatively limited size of each Materiae means most end in some sort of hegemony or downright unitary state over time, falling into patterns of unification and splintering. The Grand Materiae are exceptions, big enough to sustain numerous polities. The age ends with the dominance of The Empire and The Kingdom of W&B of their home shards, and the emergence of the Warping Ships of Nybor bridging the previously unbridgeable bringing these polities into contact with each other. Though many places yet remain isolated, an age of exploration, expansion and colonisation has begun. 

 

**[900AC – 1073AC] The Age of Wonders** – with the learning of Mist navigation and the establishment of various colonies and collections of power by the two great powers, both sides come to call the coming age the Age of Wonder, for the progress one can make even in the shadow of the apocalypse and the hamstrung Gods post-edict. The exploitation and exploration of the local shard cluster, the local “constellation”, and of Tlancayo and Teorzed see the powers on course to conflict. The age culminates in the unleashing of the build-up of rivalry and pride, and early sorceress knowledge is used to wage a bloody war across dozens of shards.  

 

**[1073AC – 1104AC] Godfall War** – the two superpowers, in unsteady balance for so long, unleashed a massive war that would come to be called Godfall, so called when the Father caused their God to fall on the Empire in order to break it's back. Swathes of the two homeland Greater Materiae are rendered inhospitable, along with much of the B&W’s colonies, suddenly and shockingly collapsing the balance of power in over 60 shards. 

 

**[1104AC] The Deicide** – Godfall was a last desperate weapon of the steadily losing Kingdom of White & Blue, to summon an avatar of the very aspect of their God right into the heart of the Imperial home-shard, to rage righteous war. It was not a successful summoning, as even great priests are not the best sorcerers, and perhaps some malign influence from powerful independent actors that saw opportunity in chaos. Instead, the avatar smashed half-formed like a meteor into the south west of Mitteland, and had terrible unforeseen consequences for all involved. The backlash broke the covenant between the people of the pope and their God, and plunged Mitteland into a series of natural and supernatural terrors, ending the war on cataclysmic terms. Neither side the victor.  

 

The summoning backlash utterly collapsed the Kingdom of White & Blue when the rock of their authority, the Pope and the Clergy, were swept out from underneath them. The shattering of the covenant had horrendous effects; it melted the minds of all those too closely connected with the former divinity, and whole swathes of their society from priests to pious paupers became living husks, functioning only on their basest of instincts which were heightened to madness. Most terrifying of all, this madness was able to spread the collapsed raging psyche of their broken god with a bite. Only the lucky, hardy and faithless were left behind to rebuild.  

 

Godfall shook the very fabric of the Empire when it hit, severely damaging nearly every major settlement west of The Great Rift as massive earthquakes rocked the land and fragments of war avatar and unleashed outsiders scoured the southern countryside, leaving disparate survivors and letting anarchy rein. As the south-west underwent massive damage, the capital was drowned in a hundred thousand outsiders following the course of the river, and those in the fallout desperately marshalled power for their own survival, further regional powers turned to their own rulership.  

 

The imperial army alongside the Emperor, abroad contesting the Iron Exclave, ended up getting swamped along with the rest of Patrie du Pape by the zombified hordes after being able to suddenly penetrate deep into enemy territory, conquering town after abandoned town. By the time they attempted to return home, it was too late. The Godfall shook the resonance of Mitteland’s warp point, and the entire Iron Fleet, depleted as it was, was lost on the return trip. While the many colonies of the Empire were essentially unscathed, this cutting off of the home shard caused the extramistal empire to collapse quite naturally. Meanwhile the Empire proper in Mitteland was aflame amongst disaster, and with the loss of the Emperor abroad whose status or death was unable to be confirmed, crippled Imperial authority and catalysed the rise of the myriad independent states even further, all claiming to do what was necessary to curb the chaos, or to be the next Emperor, or to be free of the Bronze Throne. In many cases, they may have even been right. At least at first. 

 

**[1104AC – 1761AC] Sorceress Kingdoms, The Age of Strife** – the shattered Empire and gutted Kingdom reeled from the end of their war, and underwent a period of balkanised local rule, normally by magic wielding despots (as power begets power), before slowly coalescing into new forms. It ended with the Stannis’ New Empire's third decree to strictly control magi (when it came fully into its power) and the popular revolutions spreading through Patrie.  

 

The third decree was the severe limiting of sorcery to the various sponsored colleges and establishment of mage licenses, as centuries of tyrannical magical rule and many horrifying magical experiments generated severe popular backlash and political repercussion to magic in general (in both Great Materia). The age of sorcery was stomped into the ground. Meanwhile the various colonies and conquered peoples found an end to their age of freedoms and empowerment, as the re-coalescing powers attempted to resume control over their old holdings, and military traffic of the Eternal Calm climbed once again. Still, neither empire is near the hight of their old extents. 

 

**[1761AC – 1801AC] The Dawn of a New Age, The Age of Man** – the dawning of popular sentiment and social thinking, the resurgence of only the very best of the Age of Wonders, and strictly controlled and scientific study of magic and alchemy, and the invention and refinement of the gun, propelled the worlds into a new age, where anything could happen. The leaps made in magic, and its growing prevalence in the day-to-day world, were controlled, constrained and refined, and often blended with technology to create so called “machines”, complex contraptions that rely on magic for some or all of their operation. The remnants of the Old Order quivered, and many lashed out in desperation, the last squalls of the left behind. The Age of Man had come.
