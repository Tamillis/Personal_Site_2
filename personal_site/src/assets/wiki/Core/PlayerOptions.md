Here can be found various additional player options for D&D 5e for my setting.

## Backgrounds

### Mistdiver
> “You wanna know how I got these mouths?”
>
>  – Gee “Smiles” McCackle, member of the mistdiver guild Opportunity Knocks

You were an opportunist, an individual of great ambition or foolish confidence, that saw the horrors of the Mists and the inherent unknown in the things it leaves behind as tomorrow’s paycheque. You dove into the lands that bordered the Mist wall after it ebbed back to find what plunder you could, and fight or avoid the creatures and monstrosities the Mist had tainted or left behind. Inevitably at one point the Mist tainted you too, and most mistdivers say no diver is blooded until they gain their first taint.
 
**Feature**: *Minor Mutation*
You have a small mutation that marks you as touched by the Mists. Those outside of the mistdiver community will look at you with suspicion and fear if you reveal it, believing you could be one of the very monstrosities they have been warned about since childhood. However, your mutation may aid you in ways you might not expect, and you find yourself far more resistant to further mutation. Work with your GM to determine your mutation and its potential uses and effects.

**Stats (PEDD)**: Accuracy, Perception

**Skill & Tool Proficiencies (D&D 5e)**: Investigation, Perception, Navigator’s Tools, Thief’s Tools

---|---|---
1|Third ear mounted on the forehead.| Your third ear allows you more sensitive hearing.
2|Third arm on one side of the torso.|An extra arm and hand to make use of.
3|Hair turned into wreathing eels.|A slippery advantage in brawls that needs to be kept hydrated.
4|Digitigrade Legs|Feet that have been overly extended and changed your manner of locomotion.
5|5ft tongue|Your tongue can unfurl from the mouth like a fleshy prehensile appendage.
6|Split-blood Face|The left half of your face is now that of a Tiefling (or human if already Tiefling)
7|Holey Nose|Your nose is now entirely missing, leaving a gaping hole where it once was.
8|Tail|A long tail sprouts from the base of your spine, granting balance.

### Mage Hunter
> "It was men like you who brought the Empire and its people to its knees. Now I will bring you to yours."
>
> – The Marquis Bertholdt Von Komreig, licensed mage hunter

The age of sorcerer kings and rampant planar beings birthed innumerable tragedies that instilled in people a fear of magic, exaggerated by its systemisation and spread, and haunted by the atrocities commited by the Sorcerer Kings of the Age of Strife. As control of magi became a greater and greater concern, those who would hunt down rogue magic users appeared to fill the need. Desperados, bounty hunters, ex-soldiers and other such hardened folk, like you, took up the mantle; people paid to tag & bag rogue mages in the name of the Empire.

**Feature**: *Mage Hunter’s Creed*
When dealing with hostile magic users all hunters learn various protocols for dealing with the vast and dangerous abilities of magic. You are always able to prepare for specific magics you face in your travels; be that through acquirement of equipment, use of special potions, or even employing magical items yourself. You know where to go to do that preparation or who to ask. When faced with novel hostile magics, you know where to turn to learn better protocols.

**Stats (PEDD)** - Perception and Strength

**Skill & Tool Proficiencies (D&D 5e):** Arcana, Athletics, Hunter’s Tools, Land Vehicles

**Skills (PEDD)** - Athletics, Arcana, Insight, Investigation, Exotic Weapon (Net) and Spears

**Suggested Power (PEDD)** - Keen Senses

**Equipment:** - A bear trap, a gag & manacles, a Mage Hunter’s papers, a lucky charm, a set of traveller's clothes, a pouch containing 10gp.

d8|Anti-magic Motivation
---|---
1|I was raised by those who feared magic and grew up to hate it myself. I may have never questioned my conviction.
2|I've witnessed first hand the consequences of a mage gone mad with power, and must not let that happen again.
3|The world is orderly and lawful, as the Gods and/or nature would have it. Magic violates that order and I will not stand it.
4|The government hands out licenses to kill, so long as the targets are mages. That's good enough for me
5|There was nothing more I wanted as a child than to have magic, but I wasn't born with the gift. If I can't have it...
6|A magical plague left me the only survivor of my village, the culprits must pay.
7|I just hate magic, it fills me with irrational anger.
8|Magic is a great power capable of miracles at the level of the Gods: but men are fickle and must be controlled. By me, if needs must.

## Feats

The following are feats characters can take that are present in the world of the Materium Existentiae. 

### Mana Filtering

**Prerequisites**; the ability to cast spells

Increase one of your spellcasting ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma, if you have multiple kinds of spellcasting) by 1 to a maximum of 20.

You can spend a minute concentrating to identify the Magnitude (0 to 9) and Mixture (proportion of red, green, blue, black and white) of ambient mana or the mana of a willing or unconscious creature you are touching.

When you know the mixture of ambient mana you can attune your personal mana to it once per day when you finish a short rest, choosing expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than the ambient mana magnitude, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. Alternatively, as an action, you can siphon a number of spell-slots which total your proficiency bonus from a willing or unconscious creature. If the target does not have sufficient spell slots of their own, they suffer one level of exhaustion, otherwise they lose those slots as if spending them on a spell.

You can store a spell slot into a heart stone up to the heart’s stone’s spell level as an action, and draw a spell slot from a heart stone as an action, if you have an expended spell slot of that level or higher.

### Mounted Archery

You are an expert at working from horse (or other) back and can make even the most treacherous of footings secure enough for your purposes. You gain the following benefits;
- You increase your Dexterity score by 1 to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.
- You no longer suffer from the effects of an unstable platform.
- You can mount or dismount as part of an attack action

### Weave Sight

**Prerequisites**; the ability to cast 3rd level spells

Increase your Intelligence by 1 to a maximum of 20.

You can take an intelligence (arcana) check as an action to identify any arcane spells (those available on the bard, sorcerer, warlock or wizard spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or known.

You can take an intelligence (religion) check as an action to identify any divine spells (those available on the cleric or paladin spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or knows.

You can take an intelligence (nature) check as an action to identify any nature spells (those available on the druid or ranger spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or knows.

The difficulty for these checks is the target’s spell save DC. Each target can only be targeted once per day, no matter which check was used or whether it was successful or not. If a target knows no spells of the list checked the action is spent learning that information.

## Races

### Goblinkin (Player Race)
Tan-skinned creatures, starting an almost lurid orange at birth as small vicious goblins, mature and metamorphosise, or not, into the lean disciplined machines known as Hobgoblins. The Goblinoids are not as many believe, a family of creatures, but instead a single species of creature with multiple life stages. 

Your Goblinoid character has the following racial traits;

**Ability Score Increase** – your Dexterity score increases by 1 and your Constitution increases by 1.

**Age** – goblinoids are born as Goblins and mature incredibly quickly, reaching adulthood at 3 years. If they fail to undergo metamorphosis they do not tend to live long, and finding a goblin older than 35 is rare. Hobgoblin lifetimes, if not cut short by war, can stretch to a century.

**Alignment** – Goblins are manic and unable to resist the impulses and drives at their core, and tend to be incredibly self-centred and petty. They are chaotic evil. Those that can overcome their impulses or channel their energies tend to undergo metamorphosis, becoming neutral or lawful as they do. Those few goblinoids who also temper their ego may also shift alignments from evil to neutral or even good, especially as disciplined hobgoblins looking out for the interests of the battalion over their own, showing compassion to the injured, so that they may fight again.

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 30ft.

**Darkvision** – You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Languages** – you can speak, read and (perhaps) write Common and Goblin.

**Subrace** – the blessing of Kalgradyet allows Goblinoids to transform, taking on stronger and stronger forms. All Goblinoids start as the Goblin Subrace. Then, when they have met the prerequisites, they can transform into a different subrace. Transformation means you lose all traits of one subrace and gain all traits of the other, which include adjusting ability scores and skills.

### Goblin (Goblinoid Subrace)
**Ability Score Increase** – your Dexterity score increases by 1.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Nimble Escape** – You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns. 

**Fury of the Small** – When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Nilbog (Goblinoid Subrace)

**Prerequisites** – Intelligence 13, 3rd Character Level

**Ability Score Increase** – your Intelligence score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Small

**Reversal of Mania** – your days of being subject to your own urges are gone, and you have achieved a discipline of mind that most creatures of the material world find astounding, especially in contrast to normal Goblins. You have advantage on any saving throw caused by a spell from the enchantment school of magic. You also have advantage on any further saving throws made to end an ongoing enchantment spell’s effect.

**Tinker’s Fingers** – your small and nimble fingers, much longer and slenderer than the stubby claws of a Goblin, are perfect for manipulating fine contraptions and undergoing delicate works. You gain proficiency with Artisan’s Tools, if you did not already, and if you did you add twice your proficiency bonus when using them. In addition, you may use your Artisan’s Tools to make repairs or Intelligence (Investigation) checks on non-magical clockwork devices or constructs with advantage.

### Bugbear (Goblinoid Subrace)

**Prerequisites** – Strength 13, 3rd Character Level

**Ability Score Increase** – your Strength score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Medium

**Sneaky** – you are proficient in the Stealth skill. If you were already, you add twice your proficiency bonus to Stealth checks.

**Long-Limbed** – when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

**Powerful Build** – you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

**Hooked Claws** – your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, if the creature was surprised by the Hooked Claws unarmed strike (due to a surprise round, or being hidden, etc), you can make a free grapple check against the creature.

### Hobgoblin (Goblinoid Subrace)

**Prerequisites** – Strength 13, Intelligence 13, 5th Character Level, either of the Nilbog or Bugbear subrace

**Ability Score Increase** – your Strength score increases by 1 and your Intelligence score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Medium

**Nilbog Legacy** – you have advantage on any spell saving throw caused by a spell from the enchantment school of magic. You also have advantage on any further saving throws made to end an ongoing enchantment spell’s effect. You are proficient in Artisan’s Tools.

**Bugbear Legacy** – you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. You are proficient in the Stealth skill.

**Martial Training** – after undergoing your transformations and at last being admitted into a holdfast (or from some other tutor or training), you have been trained and readied for war. You are proficient in the next tier of armour (light if you weren’t proficient in any, medium if you were proficient in light, heavy if you were proficient in medium), and you are proficient in using Shields and Simple Weapons. In addition, you are proficient in two martial weapons of your choice.

## Subraces

### **Mist Mad** (Gnome Subrace):

Many Gnomes are cautioned to avoid the Mists at all costs, and many heed those wise words. Those that don’t are often doomed to be hypnotized by the Mist’s Maddening swirls, and be drawn deep within. Those that survive are inevitably deeply changed, and far from home.

**Age** – unknown, time flows curiously in the Mists and those that can bare its touch often flow through time quite curiously themselves.

**Ability Score increase** – you increase one ability of your choice except intelligence by 1, according to your Major Mutations

**Major Mutations** – you have several major mutations warping and twisting your body in many locations, which have a collective effect. The effect of these mutations is not only to make you look like the horror that peasants tell tales of to frighten their children, enough to even make Mistdivers flinch at your visage, but one of the following;
- **Bulging Skin-Bursting Muscles** – you ignore the heavy property of weapons, you gain proficiency in Athletics, and your Strength score is increased by 1
- **Pawed digitigrade Hoof and Tail** – your movement speed is now 35ft, you gain proficiency in Acrobatics, and your Dexterity score is increased by 1
- **Armoured Shell and Scales** – your base AC when not wearing armour is 15 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number), you are resistant to Slashing damage, and your Constitution score is increased by 1.
- **Headful of Mismatched Eyes** – your passive perception is increased by 5, you gain proficiency in Perception, and your Wisdom score is increased by 1.
- **Hypnotic Bioluminescence** – you know the Friends cantrip, using your Charisma to cast the spell, you gain proficiency in Persuasion, and your Charisma score is increased by 1

**Everchanging Nature** – You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Absorb Elements spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Alter Self spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 

### **Wyldhand** (Halfling Subrace)

Gnomes are often called Fey Halflings, for their similar relationship that the Elves have with Humans, and whilst rather uncommon, one can find a Wyldhand Halfling, if they search hard enough.

**Ability Score Increase** – Your Wisdom score increases by 1

**Keen Senses** – You are proficient in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry** – You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Like the Little People can be subject to the Fae Touch, so too can they be subject to the demonic and other bloodlines too, though they are exceedingly rare thanks to their tendency to not venture beyond their burrows. These halflings of the demon blood are known as the Impmen (Tiefling Variant, see below) and those of the white blood are known as the Ásarlings (Aasimar Variant, see below).

### **Impmen** (Tiefling variant)

**Ability Score Increase** – Your Dexterity score increases by 1 and your Charisma score increases by 2

**Age** – Impmen mature at the same rate as halflings, and can live for 250 years.

**Alignment** – Impmen might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them over indulge and end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many impmen toward a chaotic and passionate alignment.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 25ft 

**Darkvision** – thanks to your outsider heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Hellish Resistance** – you have resistance to fire damage.

**Devilish Luck** – When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Halfling Nimbleness** – You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages** – You can speak, read and write Common, Infernal, and Halfling

### **Ásarlings** (Aasimar variant)

**Ability Score Increase** – your Charisma score increases by 2

**Age** – Ásarlings mature at the same rate as halflings, and can live up to 250 years.

**Alignment** – imbued with celestial power, most Ásarlings are good. Fallen Ásarlings are most often neutral or even evil.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 25ft 

**Darkvision** – thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Healing Hands** – as an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Brave** – you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Celestial Resistance** – you have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

**Languages** – you can speak, read and write Common, Halfling and Celestial

**Subrace** – three subraces of Ásarlings exist (chosen from the Aasimar subraces): protector, scourge, and fallen. Choose one of them for your character from Volo’s Guide to Monsters.

Other Little People bloodlines are rare, but they exist. When making a character from one of these bloodlines, take the base statistics for that race, and change the size to Small and the base walking speed to 25ft. In addition, they know the language Halfling, or its cultural equivalent in that shard. With your DM’s permission you may swap out a number of the base race’s traits in order to gain the halfling traits of Brave, Lucky and/or Nimbleness.

### **City Elves** (Elf Subrace)

**Ability Score Increase** – your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Agile Scaler** – You gain a climb speed equal to 30ft.

**Mask of the Urbane** – You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by crowds, smoke, structures, and other urban features.

**Political Instinct** – you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice; Deception, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.
