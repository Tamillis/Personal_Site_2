# The Church of the Everlight
One of the defining features of the 2nd Empire is its wholesale shift from a broad pantheonic belief or dedication to the Gods of Eden, those now kept firmly on the far side of the Edict and away from the Material Plane, to the philosophy come religion of the Church of the Everlight, itself a reinvention of the Church of Man once preached in the enemy state of Patrie du Pape. 

In some form or other, the missionaries of the rival Greater Materia had filtered into Imperial society ever since first contact, but little did the faith take root, and even less so when it was actively suppressed during the war. The Godfall itself saw any further input disappear and popular support shrink in the face of overwhelming damage from spiritual entities, at least at first. But the faithful were stalwart, and in time the powers they claimed waxed and were particularly effective against the tide of outsiders as well as the growing rise of tyranny from the Sorcerer Kings, slowing seeing to a grass roots blooming of popularity, particularly in the Crownlands.

### Return to Man
The Church of the Everlight has a creed that expresses seeing people become their best selves through enlightenment, prayer and dedications to the image of the First Men, or at least an idealised ur-man that may or may not have ever existed (though that is of course heresy). They worship a particular dogma of the Firstfather, Sendum, which they call the “Everlight”. That ‘The Universe Shines with Purpose, and we are the Stewards of the Torch passed to us by the Firstfather’.

One of their primary tenets is a return to First Man, before the blood of the people was twisted form their original divine image by the various Lines that exist, which whilst this provided them with great support in the face of arcane corruptions during the tail end of the deicide and during the Age of Strife, put them in contention with many of the incumbent Nobles who are proud of their fey touched breeding, and many of the ‘legitimate’ mages who value the access to The Gift bloodlines often provide. 

#### The Saints
Even many other clerics were put off, who see those with divine blood as paragons to be imitated, though the sects of the Everlight that forgave those with divine blood won out during the formation of the church, and now official dogma see those of the Divine Blood as blessed by Sendum Itself, calling them "Saints". 

### Theology
The religion is uniquely positioned in opposition to all the other Gods while also being able to push them out, as they’re entities of the Firmaments or spirits of the wild, whereas Sendum is seen as an extra-universal creator God and therefore worship worthy, not pander-worthy; and also conveniently non-participatory (as Sendum is ‘dead’ in so far as shattered and spread throughout all living beings) whilst also embodied in all life allowing church both divine power and free reign of authority. That too would be blasphemy. Sendum lives in all, as they say, and only their righteous path gives them in particular access to Its divine power.

One area of theological contention is the position of halflings in the faith. The Church of the Everlight says they are their own first man, and so deserve equal idolisation. Does that actually happen? No, especially in the original faith in Patrie du Pape, and the church refuses a split in organisation so fundamental, so it gets side-lined. 

### The Purified
One particularly zealous cohort of adherents are the Tuskmen of the New Army, many officers of whom have undergone ‘Purification’, the details of this ritual being a state secret, returning them to human form, for they see their original form as a curse. Many of those recruits and expatriates of Ihleiska became early ardent believers, propagating the new faith among the Tuskmen who remained in Czondazan and Elóna, and even a few fiefs of Ihleiska. 

### State Religion
Being an offshoot of the Kingdom of B&W’s own Church of Man, the Church of the Everlight had to undergo significant 'rebranding', and only very recently became the state religion with the ascension of Stannis Hauttergeit, who had been a staunch believer since before he entered the political stage as a young lad. His conversion is a State secret, though rumours abound about his Orc personal guard, the "First Purified" Saint Pál. Did he convert the young Emperor? Or did the Emperor him?

Ascending to the Bronze Throne young Stannis decreed that the Everlight was his religion, and thus the Empire's, naming himself Head of Church and State. In this area alone was the new Great not idolised and adherently followed, for it ruffled too many feathers. Whilst the young emperor rode the wave of fervour he had cultivated in Capital to emperorship, with the anti-corruption rhetoric striking a chord to those plagued by demented outsiders and cosmic corruption, the same support could not be said to be present in many of the other duchies, polities and cities of the Empire outside of the core of the Crownlands, and now this imposition of faith is coming back to shake this fragile Second Empire, perhaps to pieces.
