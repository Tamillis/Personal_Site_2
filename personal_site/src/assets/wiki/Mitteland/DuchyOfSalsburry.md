# Duchy of Salsburry

Over the years this ancient frontier has come under many names. The territory first grew from survivor polities of the Cataclysm that took refuge in the old stable hills now known as the Salsburry Heights, who spread into the fertile lands northward, following the new course of the rivers. They were conquered early on by Elonian forces when the peoples of what would become the Crownlands first setup outposts and sent homesteaders southwards, where it was known as the Southern March. In time it grew to be (unofficially) called the Duchy of Three Forts (Lye-on-Sea, Barlewyck and Willemwell). Now, with the incorporation of Avonsby and the official title of Duchy, it is simply known as the Duchy of Salsburry, named after the first Imperial Duke to take up the title, Willem Salsburry, in 962 A.C.

Even at the time ‘Fort’ was a poor moniker for Lye-On-Sea and Willemwell, which were more port and monastic settlement respectively, even in the late 900’s; although Barlewyck still is very much a fort, with significant reinforcement in the past few years. The other major settlement of the modern Duchy is Avonsby, first and foremost a market town servicing the arable area south of the Yontervale Hills between the river systems Twee to the west, Esk to the south and Upper Lineé to the east. The combination of large areas of highly fertile land and being in the middle of multiple transport routes between other major settlements like Lye-on-Sea, Torzen Vatner's Vast, Willemwell and the natural highway of the Lineé, saw it boom.

Geographically, the Duchy is a broad band stretching from the Wester Sea’s bulging Lynol Bay to the Lower Linneus where it exits Vabaria and becomes the Upper Lineé, following the river northwards. The southern border is the large near-mountain range of the Salsburry Heights, a set of ridgelines, lake littered vales and small mountains whose eastern portion is home to the academic and magical centre of Willemwell. To the west, where the Heights descend into the sea, lies the city of Lye-on-Sea, a former natural harbour (before the seas dropped in the deicide) and strategic location in this gap between the Imperial heartlands and the Kingdom of Damaran-Olilstia.

Squeezed between imperial expansion and the very different peoples to the south in Damaran, the peoples of Salsburry have formed a fused culture of Damarani, Imperial and their own natives. Under the pressures of Imperial settlement and investment, intent on transforming the region into a March against Damaran and the vast wilds that would one day be transformed into southern Vabaria and Ainne, it now it functions as a populous region and source of productive citizens and fertile soils for the demands of the Crownlands.

Other locations beyond the big three in Salsburry include:

- **Tomton** – the Duchy’s River Lineé connection, which is home to a large river port but otherwise is quiet and mostly focussed on farming, transportation and animal husbandry. In recent years wool mills have sprouted in the south, turning the raw goods from upstream into products to be sold downstream, and turning a tidy profit.
- **Setfalls** – a small settlement situated on a lake whose northern rim, and the entire river that feeds it, falls into the Vasts below. Unsurprisingly it is well populated with dwarves as well as men and little peoples.
- **The Swars** - as everyone knows, the swamp grows. If one were to consult hundred year old maps it would certainly seem so. In legend, the consequence of the hubris of the infamous sorcerer king Jorges the Absolute when he conquored and slaughtered the entire Glade that stood where the Swars now lurks. It is a dangerous place of black mana and missing souls, and those that prey and thrive on such things. Deep in the black swamp are rumoured to be the remains of a once thriving port city still full of treasure untraded, and the Woaden elves look longingly if fearfully at the depths of their ancestral home.

[It is merry wee England, fertile farmland caught in the cultural fusion between German-inspired Crownlands, and the more latinised folk of Damaran-Olistia]

### Avonsby
First and most northern settlment of Salsburry, it is the central hub for the farmlands south of the Yontervalend valleys, and sits on the river Twee. Technically, it is still a 'town', though its population has only risen and the construction of the new church is part of its bid to become an official Imperial City.

The market town was turned Duchy capital back during the founding, and is known as being perhaps the quintessentially peaceful town: a golden shire one might say. The town is dominated by the ducal manor and the administrative wings that flank it on either side see to the second most important bread-basket of the Empire. The complex sits on the only hill for miles around, and sits around the official square, though the town's market square lies near the river port and is not so overshadowed. Huge riverside granaries and the windmills that mill them otherwise define the skyline, storing the food stuffs that are shipped out along the Twee or sent to the caravanserai and east to the Lineé. The busy but quaint dockside is constantly jostling with long thin river barges, and staffed by busy but quaint riverside folk.

A slight ways away from the town itself is a large caravanserai style open plan stables, market and trade centre that sits at the head of the long Salsburry Way, the fairly straight road that cuts across the land, both connecting eastern farmland and also the whole region to the Linneus and the riverside market town of Tomton. The road to Willemwell also leaves the caravanserai to the south-east.

The west of Avonsby is well known for its proliferation of settlements underneath, the most populous region of the Khozmad Deeps, dominated by the salt-river laced Torzen Vatners Vast. The locals speak with their distinct accent, and the dwarves often learned Imperial Common through them, hence their own [Scottish] accent. The Dwarvish run boarding house the Either Ore shows their greater than normal impact on the region.

To the north-west is the steady encroachment of the Schwarz, and many locals repeat the adage “The Swamp Rises / The Marsh Grows”.

Points of Interest:
- **Avonsby Manor** – administrative heart of the Duchy and home to Duke Alfred Salsburry IV and duchess Alfreda.
- **Granaries** – the four huge silos and associated stores are perhaps the single largest concentration of grain anywhere in the empire, protected not by hired guards or even local militia, but by the New Army.
- **Six Windmills** - the line of six windmills that constantly churn the grains into flour stand proud along the south of the town. The largest and oldest is built from the lower floors of one of the ancient watchtowers
- **The River Tower and Ancient Tower Ruins** - The south-western “River tower”, the last of the ancient and crumbling watchtowers-four, doubles as a watchtower for the less-inhabited south-west approach. The others are nothing but crumbling ruins swallowed by the town that’s grown to overrun them.
- **Goods stores** – on the far side of the river, food stuffs go to the eastern bank and everything else gets rooted here. Warehouses and kiosks and first point of contact for all western farms and the road to Lye-on-Sea make it a mini trade hub after the Caravanserai. It is home to “The Gryphon’s Pride”, a grim and overcharged worker’s inn that has seen better days.
- **New Church** – being built incorporating one of the ruined towers. The labour seems to be prisoners from south.
- **The Lady’s Footstool** – the upmarket inn in the uptown for wealthy visitors of Avonsby Manor that don’t quite qualify to be welcomed to stay in the manor itself.
- **Either Ore** – a dwarven run inn in Lowtown that is interleaved between layers for little people and the right wing for “big people”, as the sign reads.
- **Ruined Temple** – The centre of the heart of the old town is the ruined pantheonic temple, a large structure now crumbling with its impressive large dome collapsed since the Age of Strife. A newer Everlight church and tower is being constructed at the caravanserai side of the town.

The caravanserai is also host to a large army encampment as of 1801 A.C. due to the Four Way Civil War.

### Willemwell
The only city sized settlement pre Southern Marches (if only for the then-arcane monastery & mining operation), and infamous during the Age of Strife for their dragonborn lead death squads/inquisitions that would “curb the outsider threat pouring out of the river” created by the council of two, is the arcane college city of Willemwell. It is sited upon a huge cenote found in the tumbledown crags of the eastern Salsburry Heights, that upwells vast quantities of ambient mana from the depths, and whose sides are lined with large deposits of raw mana crystal and can even cause “mote storms”.

The prestigious, industrious and scholastic town of Willemwell is home to the greatest civilian university and magic academy in the Empire, often simply called the “University” it is officially called the “Willemwell University of Arcana and High Arts”. There are also two schools in the town for children, one local offshoot of the University to train young minds, the aptly named "Willemwell Highschool of Magic", and a boarding aristocratic school, "St. Tolomeoson's", where nobles from across the Empire send their young offspring to receive primary education.

The Spiral Mines of the cenote and the sprawling Willemwell University of Arcana and High Arts on the nearby hill-ridge act as two poles with the city strung in between.

The cenote and millennia long mining operation also created and houses the dwarven hold of Ankyr-Dhom, the Blue Pick, an arcane charged dwarven people who despite almost a thousand years of symbiotic existence with the surface dwellers maintain their own separated culture, arcane tradition and sovereignty even from the local vasts, all embedded in the cenote and nearby underground.

Points of Interest
- **The Willemwell University of Arcana and High Arts** - perhaps the most famous location of the city, often mistaken to be the city by outsiders. The campus is large and slightly fractured, and it is hard to tell where the University ends and the city starts.
- **Willemwell Highschool of Magic** - [one day, I will run a magic highschool game. And it will be here] The official highschool and daughter institute of the University, it is entirely situated within the Scriptorum grounds of the university, in the Quartzridge area.
- **The Big Hat** – a venerable establishment popular with the local faculty.
- **Mage License Office** - one of the few places outside of the Imperial capital where licenses can be received to practice magic without being hunted and imprisoned.
- **Ankyr-Dhom** - the underground and independent settlement of dwarves and miners in the walls of the cenote and the caves and tunnels of the area.

### Lye-on-Sea
Lye-on-Sea has always been a port. Like most old settlements on the Wester Sea it has an old town high tier, home primarily to landowners and naval offices for the imperial navy, and a seaside tier at the new lower water level primarily occupied by industry, dockhouses and the workers. The falling of sea levels with the Deicide hit the town quite hard, for what was once ideal natural harbours became poor quality anchorage. The navy have dredged out their own Newport since, which forms the core of their new arsenal there.

Once a major port of call, it’s main traffic these days are port-of-call ships sailing between Guiezzia and Hus, and naval maintenance for the Imperial Navy. Talk of a grand ram-way connecting the city to the westernmost river, the Eisling, by climbing up through the red clay hills of the western Heights, and so on down to the Clearwater Lake and the road to Torzen Vatner's Vast and Avonsby excite the economic interests of the city and brings the Lord-Mayor hope of prosperity. Doubly so since the northern road grows ever more dangerous. Doom slowly creeps, as the Swars crawls southward toward the city’s nominal territory. "The Marsh Grows".

Points of interest:
- **Newport** – the dredged out new bay after the sea-level fell. Quite artificial and organised on an elongated grid. The old harbour wall was repurposed as a defensive structure much relied on while the port was the soul military outpost of a beleaguered Empire during the Age of Strife. The majority of the area is still a military installation, though the outer piers of the port and dockside are open to civilian use. It is currently undergoing a renovation and reinforcement due to the civil war south.
- **Old docks** – a now disorganised, dirty and relatively lawless area where the natural harbour used to be, sandwiched between the New Port and the dilapidated old Abbey. Due to the red clay used in the old abbey walls and rich in filfth and dangerous opportunists, the area is often called the Red-run. 'Red the clay and red the blood. Red the corpse left in the mud'.
- **Abbey** – the once religious heart of the settlement. The undocumented and vast catacombs are as old, if not older, than the settlement itself. The sacking of the city 150 years ago during the Strife and the recent official switch of faith has left it bereft and its Abbot lacking in authority. At least its old red walls are still standing, made from the local clay in the tail-end of the Salsburry Heights.
- **Coast Road** – heading north, the Coast Road, also known as the Dwarf Way or the Salsburry Highroad (to Tomton), winds its way to Torzen Vatner’s Vast’s entrance and further to Avonsby. The northern part of the city here, being quite high up and upwind, is the nice part of town with respectable stores and services.
- **Southern Road** – and the sprawling new settlement (after the deicide) the wraps around the nearby hills makes a sort of secondary settlement of cheaper folk, as well as accessing some of the farming available at this north-western tip of the Nannaeag valley.
