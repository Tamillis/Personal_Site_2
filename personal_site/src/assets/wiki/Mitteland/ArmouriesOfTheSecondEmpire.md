# Armouries of the Second Empire & The New Army 

## Expanded Equipment 

### A History of War 

The culmination of military power during the Godfall War was the heavy-fist doctrine, the heavy cavalry, employed to smash apart enemy lines and create the openings needed to break apart and slaughter the enemy. Many variations of the heavy-fist approach were employed such as war ogres or vampire covens, but massed well armoured cavalry were always the easiest to field for those whose command of sorceries was not so vast, and even for many who were. Dozens of divisions of heavy-cavalry and their equivalents would smash into veritable seas of peasant levies and militia, sometimes strengthened and supplemented by professional fighting men. This was the age of great powers at war.

After Godfall, during the squabbling of the strife, smaller, more elite forces arrayed against similar sized opponents became the norm, and the Sorcerer kings in their small break-away states tried again and again to one up each other to better enable their limited resources and manpower to defeat the enemy. Heavy cavalry faltered in its might and they began to see far less use in the field, too few and arrayed against much tougher foes. This techno-magical arms race birthed one particular invention, utterly mundane but utterly game changing for it. Mass produced, high grade, black powder munitions. Firearms and cannon followed swiftly after. 

The ubiquity of nitre and other ingredients in Mitteland's dominating central mountain range, The Fold, the ease of fielding effective troops with firearms, and their ability to penetrate most armours, saw their rapid rise and employment across the empire. In combination with pike-wielding soldiers, the age of the cavalry charge died a bloody death. Soon the mounted were bearing firearms of their own and came to be called Dragoons. 

The new Emperor rose on the back of his reformed New Army, which employed well-trained professional soldiery at all levels, fielding firearm troops more swiftly, effectively, and on far greater a scale than those that opposed him could, and also combined this with structured no-nonsense massed mage power, alchemical squad-level healers distributed through the front ranks with behind the lines Everlight medic officer support, and highly trained and effectively equipped skirmishers. To cap it off, there was a corps of officers chosen on merit alone, required to be apolitical, without office or land, and with access to magical and mundane communications, swift, accurate and far reaching. With his new, personally loyal, army Stannis single-handedly changed the face of warfare and pioneered it into the proactive, responsive, rapid manoeuvre scene of today.  

As he swept duchy after duchy into his embrace, his New Army battalions simply grew in number, dissenters turned into trained loyal soldiers. The Age of Strife was done. The monument of his success rose as the institutions of the New Army, which stand by ready to recruit, train, and arm any civilian to become part of a cohesive fighting whole. The tools and equipment of that new army can be found here.  

### Firearms & Munitions 

Here is a list of equipment and rules for the use of firearms and munitions, that the average soldier may find themselves with, the hunter may purchase with a permit, or the average revolutionary may find, barter for, or steal. 

All firearms and munitions are considered martial weapons and are included in martial weapons proficiency, except demo-barrels, which are adventuring equipment. All firearms also belong to the category of “firearms”. Firearms are further split into the categories of “longarms”, “sidearms”, “munitions” and “artillery”.  

The **Sharpshooter** feat does not prevent disadvantage when firing at long range with firearms, the large long range of firearms is an inherent property of their construction and a trade-off commanders and wielders need to be aware of.  

**Damp Misfire** – All base firearms, when used in damp conditions (such as at sea, in a cave, in a marsh; DM discretion), misfire. On an attack roll of 1, the gun misfires; the attack fails, and a clearing bonus action to clean the gun is required before it can be fired again, leaving it unloaded. Older or more unreliable weapons may have a constant misfire chance, noted by the property misfire. 

All firearms can accept modifications, listed below, allowing guns to be tailored to their owner’s specifications. 

Additionally, some classes start with the following proficiencies; 

**Artificer** – arquebuses, muskets and pistols 

**Bard** – pistols 

**Cleric** – buckshot guns 

**Monk** – sidearms, which count as monk weapons 

**Rogue** – sidearms, carbines and buckshot guns

a.	The X in Ammunition X refers to the number of times the weapon can be fired before needing to be reloaded. No value means one shot per reload.

b.	A flammable object hit by this ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.

c.	The Fire Lance also has the properties of a lance, for normal use. The firing of a fire lance can only occur once, then must be reloaded outside of combat after 1 minute's work and appropriate materials.

d.	Grenades and Firebombs effect an area, as such instead of attack rolls effected creatures make a dexterity save vs a DC of 8 + the thrower’s dexterity modifier + the thrower’s proficiency bonus. On a successful save the target takes half damage from grenades and firebombs or does not suffer the effects of the flashbomb.

#### *Gun Properties*
**Armour Piercing & Light Armour Piercing (D&D 5e)** – the weapon ignores some or any benefit of armour to a target's AC. The target's AC is instead the default 10 + Dexterity Modifier (that is allowed by the armour they are wearing) for fully piercing, or Armour – 2 (to a minimum of 10) + dexterity modifier (that is allowed by the armour) for lightly piercing. It essentially functions as a to hit bonus.

**Armour Piercing & Light Armour Piercing (PEDD)** – the weapon ignores some benefit of Armour to a target's Defence. The target's Armour is reduced, to a minimum of 0, by 2 for Light Armour Piercing and by 6 for Armour Piercing.

**Cartridge Loading** – due to the elaborate procedure of preparing a muzzle loading gun for its next shot, it takes an attack or an action to reload firearms, and a free hand.

**Knockdown** – effected characters have to pass a DC 12 Constitution check or be knocked prone.

**Knockback X** – effected characters have to pass a DC 12 Constitution check or be thrown X ft and made prone. Additionally, they take falling damage as if they fell X feet (regardless of the distance actually thrown).

**Misfire** - on an attack roll of 1, the gun misfires; the attack fails, and a clearing bonus action to clean the gun is required before it can be fired again, leaving it unloaded.

**Scatter X** – weapons with this property also target any creature within 5ft of the target, using the same to hit roll, for the damage indicated in X. The scatter property is not in effect if the primary target is 10ft or less from the attacker.

#### *Ammunition*

**20 Paper Cartridges** – these pre-prepared cartridges were invented in the Imperial capital and rapidly took over from manually priming, loading, and wadding shot, which used to take far longer and was far more prone to mistake. Unlike other ammunition, paper cartridges cannot be reused. The powder, paper, and wax wadding is burnt up upon firing, and the lead ball is often missing (in the ground or the body of the target) and always deformed. 20 cartridges can be bought for 1gp, and are of the type “longarm”, “sidearm” or “buckshot”. Each can only be used with its associated weapons, and each cost the same.

#### *Longarms*

**Arquebus** – the first of the firearms, the arquebus was initially used by experimentalists and inventors whose early designs were unreliable, impractical and often just as dangerous to their user as to their target, but their propensity to punch through thick hides and layered scales made them quickly popular with specialist hunters, for whom one shot was all they needed. The functioning arquebuses still employed, as old relics, novelties, or as no other choice, come from these later designs, where at least they don't blow up your face as near as much, even if they’re still prone to misfire.

**Musket** – the musket is the evolution of the arquebus and benefits from two key improvements; a longer and better barrel (curtesy of better iron working and specialist gunsmiths flourishing in the economy) and the flintlock firing mechanism, which is far more reliable and practical than the original lit match of the first arquebuses. Most arquebuses these days have been retrofitted with proper flintlocks, or are produced with them by amateur gunsmiths unable to forge to the proper specifications that a musket barrel requires.

**Carbine** – the carbine is a musket cut short, making it much lighter and much easier to haul around a battlefield. The shorter length does, however, sacrifice its effective range. Its portability, though, is its greatest benefit, and is the only longarm that can be fired from a single hand without breaking any bones, which makes it ideal for the new dragoon platoons of the New Army.

**Buckshot Gun** – the buckshot has a much wider barrel than other guns, and fires different ammunition, after which it is named. Buckshot consists of many small pieces of metal, often not evenly shaped, which spreads out of the weapon in a dense cone and does significant superficial damage to any soft target.

*Sidearms*

**Pistol** – the smallest of sidearms, and therefore the most ubiquitous amongst the population, especially amongst those not supposed to bear arms. This small package can deliver more punch than a trained man with a sword, even if it is a one-shot weapon, whilst being small enough to conceal in a deep pocket. However, its small size and the corners cut in mass production make it unreliable and prone to misfire.

**Pepper Box** – made from 6 parallel barrels that rotate around the central axis to quickly enable the firing of the next round, its design was the first firearm to enable multiple shots per reload. Musket versions have been made by inventors and tinkerers, but were unreliable and unwieldy in the extreme, with only the pistol version being produced en-masse. They are much loved, though the complexity of their construction makes them somewhat expensive for their size.

**Sawn-Off Gun** – the Buckshot Gun but with an extremely reduced barrel, first created by literally sawing off the barrel of a normal buckshot, has since been refined and redesigned with its shorter barrel in mind, making it far less likely to kill its user. The shorter barrel makes the gun far easier to wield, but severely limits its range and stopping power. Nevertheless, this pocketful of devastation is rather popular in certain circles.

#### *Modifications*

**Revolving Chamber modification** – following the pepperbox this was the next successful attempt at a multi-fire gun, this time for single barrel guns, bypassing the weight and difficulty of the pepperbox. The revolving chamber modification, the 'revolver', converts any gun or sidearm from Ammunition (X/X) to Ammunition 6 (X/X) by introducing a six chamber-wheel at the base of the barrel. The precise machining and fine materials needed to produce this modification, and the expertise of completing the modification, makes it quite expensive. The cost is increased by +50g for pistols or +70gp for muskets/carbines. Other guns cannot use this modification.

**Wheellock modification** – flintlocks were much more usable than the old free-standing matches or matchlock system, but still prone to misfiring in damp conditions. The internally housed friction based 'Wheellock' system, so named for the wheel-like appearance of its external housing, ignores any *misfire* property and also the *Damp Misfire* rule as it does not rely on a spark. However, the large design restricts it to longarms only. Gun cost is increased by +20gp.

**Arcane Ammunition Array modification** – the gun is heavily imbued with arcane enchantments that allows it to summon pseudo-cartridges within the gun, enabling the *cartridge loading* and *misfire* properties to be ignored, as well as the need for paper cartridge ammunition. As such this modification cannot be taken with the Wheellock or Revolver modifications.

The array needs to be recharged every 10 shots with the character's mana (a 1st level spell slot or greater) as an action or make use of a mana battery instead. 

Some arcane guns have a mana battery receptor integrated as part of their production, enabling batteries to be quickly loaded and unloaded (as one of a character's attacks in a round, or as a bonus action), eliminating the need for a user that can recharge the array. Any gun can use this modification, at an increased cost of +150gp (for no battery) or +200gp (with a battery receptor & 1 battery). Batteries cost 40gp from honest vendors and can be recharged for one 1st level spell slot each as an action.

**Rifling Modification** – big game hunters were the first to employ the trick of putting spin on their projectiles to significantly increase accuracy, because for them one shot one kill wasn't just efficient hunting, but a creed. Rifling however is expensive, difficult, and prone to fouling, and was only really noticeably better with the special "feathered ball" or "shuttle" that was swiftly invented shortly after. Rifling doubles the short range (to a maximum of the long range) of any *Long gun*, but requires expensive *Shuttles* (10gp per 20 cartridges) instead of normal paper cartridges, and introduces a constant *misfire* chance (despite other modifications), where on a 1 a character's weapon is jammed, does not fire, and requires a clearing bonus action to make it usable again in an unloaded state. Rifling a barrel increases the cost by +50gp.

**Bayonet** – *longarms* can be attached with a bayonet, a dagger like blade specially designed to clip securely onto the end of a gun barrel. Such firearms also count as melee weapons dealing 1d6 piercing damage, however the weight of the bayonet makes the weapon unwieldy. Any ranged attacks made with a longarm with a bayonet have a –2 to hit modifier. As an action a bayonet can be unfixed and stowed (removing its effects), or drawn and fixed. A bayonet costs 8gp.

**Scope** – *longarms* except the buckshot gun can be attached with a finely crafted scope, made from small lenses in sequence that function to magnify the target and assist with aiming at a distance. Only in recent years has the precision and uniformity required to mass produce such lenses come about, but even then they’re expensive. The long range of the arquebus and musket increases by 50%, and the carbine by 50ft. The scope costs 500gp.

*Munitions*

**Fire Lance** – a modified and reinforced lance with a charge affixed to the end of it, for punching into large targets and dealing additional damage on top of the spearing the target receives from the lance itself. The lance's charge must be detonated as part of a successful attack, dealing its damage after the attack's base damage. Once used the charge must be rebuilt and re-applied, taking 1 minute's strenuous action, and black powder and metallic components costing 10gp.

**Flashbombs** – small wood and paper canisters filled with magnesium laced powder that explode after being lit and thrown, causing an extremely bright flash of light and an incredibly loud bang, often loud enough to rupture eardrums. 

**Firebombs** – rumoured to be made from the ground up bones of devils mixed with alchemist's fire, these wooden canisters explode after being lit and thrown, and chuck burning viscous fluid all over their victims, which sticks and cannot be removed until it burns through, burning far hotter and doing far more damage than any normal fire would.

**Grenades** – small iron shells filled with blackpowder, they were originally made with clay and were the first military application of blackpowder. Then replaced with thin iron that fragmented into sharp slivers after exploding, victims are simultaneously slashed and burned by these small bombs.

**Demolitions Barrel** – A simple keg filled with blackpowder, modern demo-barrels actually use a different grain more suited to larger explosions, and specialist barrels that better shape the resulting explosion. Bar none, the demo barrel produces the largest single blast, and is used generously in mining and in siege warfare. What an adventurer sees in so much bang is entirely up to them, though the sheer destructive capabilities of them means they are heavily regulated, and not easily bought or transported.

### Adventurers and Guns

Guns are an emergent technology, and only in the last 40 years have they truly swept the battlefield of all the old unit formations, of swordsmen and archers, of catapults and ballistae. This is because they are excellent weapons of warfare.

The same won't necessarily be said of adventurers, and other skirmish type units, who expect to partake in much smaller scale engagements with often vastly different circumstances. The main problem with firearms is their need to reload. When firing in layered ranks designed to offset this weakness, firearms are a terror to behold. To an individual facing a charging minotaur, a firearm can quickly become a rather ineffective leaden club. Especially if that first shot misses.

Many adventurers then quite naturally stick to older weapons and fighting styles, and the much higher incidence of magic that their fights often entail. However, some characters might find themselves adapting to the way of the gun and adopt firearms (and particularly munitions) into their arsenal despite their drawbacks. It is entirely their choice.

As for siege weapons, well, if adventurers do get their hands on them, they are situational. But when that situation calls on them, they're quite effective.

### Cannon

Though only fielded by armies, ships, and used as defence in forts due to their unwieldiness and expense, cannon have changed the face of warfare and combat. The sheer amount of damage output without a single drop of mana or overly complex machine, just the simple alchemy of black powder and a sphere of cold iron, has made their employment during sieges and largescale battles universal very quickly, before even the arquebus.


|**Name**|**Cost**|**Damage**|**Weight**|**Properties**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Falconet|1000g|4d8, piercing|400lbs|Siege weapon 2 (500 / 2000)|
|Culverin|2000g|5d10, piercing|2000lbs|Siege weapon 4 (1000 / 4000)|
|Bombard|5000g|6d12, piercing|10T|Siege weapon 8 (800 / 3200)|
|Mortar|1000g|4d8, bludgeoning|1600lbs|Siege weapon 3 (- / 2000), Indirect Fire|

**Siege Weapon X (Y / Z)** – this weapon requires a crew of X intelligent creatures to operate properly and has a short range of Y and a long range of Z. It can only be operated when stationary. In order to relocate them they need to be drafted to a horse and carriage team (or other such conveyance), and often move slowly. Siege weapons do not count as ranged martial weapons for the purposes of class features and feats, they are their own category of tool proficiency.

**Indirect Fire** – the weapon fires in an arc to land the shot on the target, ignoring interdicting obstacles, and can be fired on positions even without line of sight. This does however mean all shots are "long range".

**Falconet** – a smaller cannon, the falconet is most often employed in the field as its smaller size makes it much easier to manoeuvre and keep up with the changing circumstances of a battle. Recent designs also feature carriages with incorporated pitch-adjustment screws, making them much easier to aim too. Smaller ships often also use falconets, due to limitations on their weight.

**Culverin** – guns that fire 10 to 15 pound shot, the culverins lob these heavy projectiles at greater distances than their smaller cousins, delivering far more force. However their cumbersomeness causes them to see much of their use only during sieges or ship-to-ship engagements. The old castles and defences of the past have been rendered utterly obsolete to the roar of the culverin, to the point where city walls are starting to be abandoned all together, in favour of denser, layered, angular defences and forts.

**Bombard** – these are huge immobile siege cannon, based on the old principle "bigger is better". These monstrous wrought iron beasts lob huge projectiles, up to a foot across, huge distances and cause incredible damage. Their size makes them impossible to use in the field, and slow to set up for anything but long-haul sieges, but when they are, their roar can be heard on the other side of the Shard.

**Mortar** – like a scaled down bombard, then put at a sharp angle, mortars enable large shot to be fired indirectly. Mortars are unique in that this indirect fire allows them to ignore most defences, but also makes them inherently inaccurate.

**Mortar Bomb** – the large calibre of mortars means they can handle iron shell bombs, which explode during or shortly after impact. These replace normal mortar solid shot, and normal mortar damage, with 2d8 bludgeoning and 4d8 burning damage.

### War College Equipment

The War College in the Imperial Capital spews out the officers and war magi of its New Army, the heart and brain of the army Emperor Stannis forged and employed to reclaim the Empire from the Sorcerer Kings. The college are now deploying straight to the field to combat dissent the embers of revolution that have spilled over from the Blue Republic before they conflagrate into an inferno.

The officers receive regimented training and extensive specialisation courses, allowing them to fulfil whatever battlefield role it is they are sent to lead. Many officers pass general purpose training to lead standard troops in the field, covering firearms tactics and counter-setpiece tactics. The sorcerous kings were always ones for aces up sleeves and lethal personal projects, and though they are gone, the tricks, tactics and adaptability needed to combat them, are not.

The training and loadout an officer leaves the college with depends on his destination unit, but typically follow one of the following classifications; musketeer, sapper, dragoon, skirmisher, cannoneer, medical officer, signalman, logistics officer, etc. 

The magi of the college are particularly feared, not because they are great and deadly wizards, but because they are companies worth of competent mages drilled and trained to fight alongside and enable their officers and the armies, and of course as well as each other. They are fearsome because massed magic design to support and multiply the effectiveness of an army simply works. Part of their competence is in no small part because they are equipped to do the job by the college, and thus the Empire, not their own pocket. Though no graduate gets the full complement of gear, especially the more specialist pieces meant for corresponding specialist magi and officers on the field, the graduates of the college have access to a series of magical items of significant practicality, often for free.

The officers and magi often make use of the same equipment, depending on assignment and personal preference. On first inspection it can be quite hard to distinguish an officer and his attendant mage apart, at least visually, if you don’t know what to look for. Indeed, most magi are officers, and most officers magi.

College equipment is not normally sold, especially the magical items or technical pieces. Nevertheless, their market value is given should, for whatever particular reason, the item be up for sale.

#### *College Equipment*

**Ammo Bandoleer** – a leather set of pouches positioned across the chest, it provides room for up to 20 prepared paper cartridges which can be safely stuffed into the muzzle of the gun and rammed into position, without requiring the soldier to root around bags for them. Alternatively, the bandoleer can hold 12 paper cartridges and 2 munitions (except demo barrels). The bandoleer is an essential piece of equipment needed to be of any use on a battlefield for any soldier. It is worth 8sp.

**Clearsight Goggles** – officers, mages and skirmishers benefit the most from being able to pierce the veils of alchemical gases and massed gunpowder discharge, and to that end Clearsight Goggles were produced. The enchantments vary in potency, and therefore cost, but the standard issue goggles of the college can see through any obscuring clouds of gas up to a depth of 60ft as if there weren't there at all. The 60ft version is worth 300gp.

**Emergency Mundane Descent System** – a voluminous amount of light silks bound by reinforced thread to a harness allows an individual without magic who finds themselves at unexpected altitudes to descend safely like a feather-seed on the wind. When wearing an EMDS, a character can make a DC10 Acrobatics check to deploy it mid-air. When successfully deployed they fall at a safe rate of 120ft per round, taking no damage when landing. It is worth 50gp.

**Glamorite Cloth** – glamorite is woven from special silks and imbued with specific properties of blue mana crystals, making them exceedingly expensive. Nevertheless, the protection it provides against exotic and arcane effects means it is in high demand. Elite units and officer-magi are often equipped in glamorite uniforms. Glamorite cloth can be used to modify the cloth of any armour, providing the wearer with resistance to *Force* damage for +750gp, or be worn as a Glamorite Underlayer for 750gp.

**Magograph Relay** – the relays are small machines that send pulses of mana to paired devices. Their extreme simplicity allows them their great range, cost-effectiveness and reliability. As part of communication networks, they need to be paired to switchboards that enable different relays to connect to one other by using the switchboard as an intermediary. These varying length pulses, simple ons and offs, have been combined into a full code known as Breese Code, able to send letters, known as telegraphs, across huge distances, even to different Shards, and has revolutionised governance and business. A relay costs 75gp whilst a switchboard costs 375gp.

**Manometers** – curious devices made for measuring the local ambient mana levels, they are used mostly by cartographers and explorers to precisely map the ley contours and ethereal high and low points. They are exceptional useful during military grounds surveys, who need to know what levels of magic can be both called upon, and the likelihood of errant magic running wild. The various hunting lodges make abundant use of them, for it's very useful to know once you've crossed the boundary into the territory of horrifying monsters. Manometers are often bought and sold on the open market, around the value of 150gp, depending on their quality and specificity.

**Marching Boots** – the supremely successful Dictator of Patrie Du Pape, when asked if he could have anything (more than he already had mutter some) what would he have? He answered; "Legion Boots", were Imperial shoemakers so well renowned even well before Stannis' time. Soldiers of the New Army are issued with their Imperial Boots, a standardised and modernised version of old Legion Boots, when they pass their training, and keep them for life. They wear well, and can see a man march 15 miles in full kit, fight a battle after, and be able to march again the next day. Characters with marching boots do not suffer exhaustion for undergoing long forced marches, equivalent to moving at a quick pace all day. They are worth 2gp.

**New Army Uniform** – part of the reforms of the New Army was the implementation of proper uniforms of specific design and colour. Though over time variation occurred, particularly between battalions, the uniform became iconic of the new Emperor's sweeping armies and conquests. Simple charcoal grey under layers and the maroon jacket and filigree made from the dye of the tulips around the capital come together, alongside various brass pins, buttons and clasps, to give the uniform its distinct image. The boots, though part of that image, are separate, and must be bought separately.

Variants exist for almost every role and battalion, and of course officers and magi employ their own often much more elaborate uniforms, increasing in pomp as the ranks advance. A basic uniform comes in at 3gp, and is deducted from a soldier's wage. Officer and mage uniforms fetch from 10gp to as much as 50gp or a 100gp for the most elaborate highest ranks. These well to do individuals are expected to pay for the uniforms as part of their college enrolment.

The uniform commands certain respect from all members of the Empire, those honourably discharged marked by the royal tulip lapels, though deserters are spat upon, and normally shot by local authorities.

**Officer-Issue War College Patented Wandsabre** – those (many) officers that undertake the mage initiate course (or higher), or Magi who undergo officer training, are expected to furnish themselves with a wandsabre for practical and station purposes. The wandsabre is a sabre whose hilt and core are woven in the precise same manner as a wand, effectively making them one. Wandsabres come in various designs. The standard is a shortsword, whilst there exists custom longsword, scimitar and rapier variants. All wandsabres double as wand arcane foci, alongside their weapon's normal statistics.

Wandsabres are monopolised by the college, and only sold to its officer magi, as such they are in short supply and only available on the blackmarket, and stand out to those in the know when they aren't expected. Their face value is 30gp (shortsword) / 35gp (longsword) / 40gp (rapier) / 40gp (scimitar), but face value means little to the blackmarket, especially when they are so hard to acquire and liable to suspicion.

**Pistol Rack** – the rack is an important part of any dragoon's kit and allows four pistols to be easily accessible while on horseback by keeping the pistol handles in easy reach of the saddle and the rider, allowing the drawing and stowing of each pistol as a free part of any attack. Each must be reloaded separately like normal. Pistols in a rack can be fired in sequence as part of one attack action, if the character has the Extra Attack feature. The rack costs 5gp.

**Purebreathing Close-Wearing Facemask** – the modern battlefield is home not only to massed gunfire, but curtains of choking smoke, blinding gas, and burning vapours. Alchemical warfare has been known since time immemorial, but the Sorcerer Kings were the ones to indulge in its wanton use. Now it is a practical tool of warfare, and to not use it is to hamstring yourself, though movements have been made on an intermistal level to ban its use. Regardless, the graduates of the college began to acquire and then order en-masse facemasks with simple enchantments to filter harmful particles from the air, to avoid poisons and other dangerous gases one often finds. A rarity in the days of peasant levies, professional armies now often foot the bill to prevent their expensively-trained foot soldiers from collapsing in the first minute of warfare. The mask confers resistance to *acid* and *poison* damage that would be inhaled, and advantage on saves against poisons or disease that are inhaled. It has a value of 150gp, though mass production and bulk sales lower the price for the college itself.

**Riding Boots** – officers of the New Army do not march with their troops, they ride ahead of them as fits their station and training. As such they don't wear the oft coveted marching boots, but their own calf high polished-to-a-gleam riding boots. These riding boots, designed especially with stirrups in mind, allow officers to easily stay secure in the saddle, even in the midst of battle. Riding boots confer advantage to animal handling checks made to prevent from being dismounted. Riding boots cost 15gp.

**Sending Necklace** – the necklace is a core piece of any signals mage's equipment as it enables them to communicate with the next chain up in command, and to deliver orders to all those directly below them, without any lines of sight and up to a mile away (though more specialist pieces can reach further ranges and offer further complexity). It does this by functioning as a "target" for Message magic and relaying that message to its paired necklaces. By simply channelling another spell it is also much cheaper and easier to manufacture. Every officer group is always attached with a signals mage, if not a group of them, and many units in the field boast at least one as well. Signals magi are amongst the lowest ranking of mage, but the easiest to train, as they only need the functional knowledge of one cantrip, Message, (and basic training of course) before being ready for the field. The sending necklace costs 75gp.

**Snuffbox** – a small often decorated box that contains some snuff, a popular commodity with the upperclasses, that brings a little clarity of mind and focus when a pinch is inhaled through the nose, a useful thing on and off the battlefield. Any intelligence checks made in the next half an hour are made with a +2 bonus, though over use leads to addiction and loss of the benefit. Snuffboxes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, varying wildly in ostentatiousness and value. Snuff itself can be bought at 2s per pinch.

**Standard Issue Alchemy & Reagents Bandoleer** – worn across the chest with plenty of potion slots and pouches, enabling the alchemist easy access to what he needs at any given moment. It functions as a component pouch whilst providing quick (free) access to four potions (or munitions) as if they were always in hand. It costs 26gp.

**Standard Issue Side Wand and Holster** – for more delicate operations, a typical wand is necessary, and every qualified mage leaves the college with the wand they trained with, holstered in a quick draw sling under their non-dominant arm that also prevents the wand from falling out during vigorous locomotion. The wand functions as a spellcasting focus, and the holster allows the wand to be draw or stowed for free. Aside from the normal wand cost (10gp), the holster has a value of 6sp.

**Teleportation Anchors** – as teleportation of frontline-wrecking set-pieces became common place, blanket counter-teleportation wards in turn became common place on any battlefield with high amounts of expected sorcery. The answer of the Empire and the old legion college was the production of teleport anchors, whose keystone a mage can tune to and recall themselves, and their unit should they pull the spell off properly, even in the presence of wards. That these anchors also made it much easier for lower level magi to pull off the spell even in the chaos of a fight, was not overlooked. However, these anchors are not cheap, nor light, and normally only 3 to 5 would ever be employed by a side at once, but their tactical use has been invaluable. The modern college makes use of a collection of anchors, though it too seldom deploys them in any number, even as the advances in arcane imbibement have allowed for the production of lighter and lighter anchors.

Each anchor is attuned to a keystone, and bearers of the keystone can teleport to the anchor, regardless of interdicting wards. Keystone bearers can cast (or learn) the *Teleport* spell as if it were a 4th level spell, using one of their 4th level slots, however the destination is always the anchor. The spell cannot be cast normally except as a 7th level spell. The anchor also allows all mishaps and other targeting risks to be ignored, though the mage must be familiar with the anchor before being able to make use of it (and not just the keystone).

As a magic item, Teleportation Anchors are not for sale in open markets. They have a value of 1000gp.

**Thickweave Gambeson Underlayer** – many modern soldiers have no physical protections at all. They are always expensive (especially when outfitting entire units) and restrictive when it comes to movement, and firearms render the protection utterly moot more often than not. This said the commanders of elite forces or skirmishers, or any unit expected to take part in a melee, often demand their soldiers to "Grab the Thick". Thickweave Gambesons provide basic physical protection and have the statistics of padded armour, without being as bulky (no stealth disadvantage). They are worth 10gp.

**Three-tone Whistle** – the New Army perfected the use of simple flags, whistles and horn calls to rapidly and accurately manoeuvre armies in the field. Alongside the practice of using Message sendings to enable instant full communication, this redundancy of communication enabled the New Army to wheel on an enemy as a single fighting force on numerous occasions, even with magic nullified and the foe expecting disarray. The three-tone whistle is the last line, and all officers carry one and know how to communicate with it, for the event when magic is dampened, the bugler is dead, and the flags can't be seen. They cost 8sp.

**Timepiece** – most officers need to track time for their reports and manoeuvres, particularly over the course of campaigns. As such they must purchase these wind-up time trackers, often called 'pieces. These 'pieces were so useful for administrative and trade purposes that they saw rapid adoption across the civilian sector of the Empire as well, and many a well-to-do family prides themselves on antique or bespoke timepieces, often passing them down through the family, even if they've only been in circulation for the past 100 years. They allow for the automatic accurate telling of time, without the need for a skill check.

Timepieces, like snuffboxes, come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and designs. However, their complexity makes even the cheapest timepiece cost at least 200gp.

### Expanded Fighting Styles

With the adoption of new weapons, came the adoption of new fighting styles to make use of them, and some minor edits to current fighting styles. Fighters have access to all fighting styles. Paladins have access to Breacher and Duelling Edit. Rangers have access to Akimbo, Marksman, Duelling Edit, and Sniper.

**Akimbo** – when wielding two light ranged weapons and you make an attack action with one, as a bonus action you can make an attack with the other weapon. You do not add the ability modifier to the damage roll of the second attack, unless the modifier is negative.

**Marksman (replaces Archery)** – you gain +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons without the *Scatter* property.

**Breacher** – whenever you roll a 1 or 2 for damage with firearms, you may reroll the damage die, and must keep the new roll.

**Duelling Edit** – When wielding a one-handed melee weapon or a sidearm, and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.

**Sniper** – You gain a +2 to damage rolls if you attack a creature 60ft or further away with a ranged weapon.

### Firearm Feats

All firearm feats require proficiency with at least one firearm.

The **Sharpshooter** feat does not prevent disadvantage when firing at long range with firearms.
