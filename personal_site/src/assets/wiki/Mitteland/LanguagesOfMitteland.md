# Languages of Mitteland

## The Spoken Languages of Mitteland
In the Age of Man, 1800A.C.

**Imperial Common** – the official language of the citizens of the Empire, separated into the clear dialectal groups Eastern and Western. West of The Fold are the western dialects of Crown Common, Coast Common, Marchian, and Varian. The eastern dialects are those of the peoples of Ihleiska and the Mid-South, and though understandable they are markedly different both from each other and from the tongues of the west, particularly the Mid-South dialect which is more commonly called "The Drawl". Imperial Common is the language of trade and the common language of the shard.

**Damarani** and **Olistiano** – in the Kingdom of Damaran-Olistia two languages dominate, and neither are that similar to Imperial Common at all, bar some shared vocabulary. Often called cousins, Olistiano is used only in the small doughnut state, and Damarani is the main language of commerce and politics for much of the south.

**Ludorol** – a more distant cousin of Damarani and Olistiano, and spoken in the many counties of Ludoro. Somewhat infamously known in the rest of the Empire as the language of pirates.

**Old / Court Common** or **Elónian** – the language of the Empire during the time of Iman the Great, it is no longer spoken by common folk, and since the reforms it's no longer used as the language of court or law either. Nevertheless, the learned and the aristocratic often use it with each other or to demonstrate their "superiority" to others, or to flavour their common speech and present a façade of sophistication.

**Tuskic / Keqbërës** – the language of the more eastern Ihleiska kingdoms ruled by the Tuskmen, and their barbaric Orcish cousins that still run rampant in The Spur. Through all of Ihleiska most folks speak both Imperial Common and Tuskic, and only the most isolated and fundamentalist of the Ihleiska kingdoms speak purely Tuskic, especially since Stannis’ Campaign through to the Spurmark Hinterlands and the military integration and political crackdowns that followed.

**Hills Tongue** – the language of the scattered folks of the League of Barrows and Shires, and its defacto official language, and of many ancient backwater villages in the Imperial Hinterlands, Salsburry, and even some in the Varian Highlands and Maeryn. (Replaces PHB Halfling).

**Gladéllion** – the language of the Glades, of the wild elves, woaden, and those Old Blood that truly keep to their long stretching traditions, and in a simplified and basterdised form the language of the few human settlements beholden to the glades. Many Grey Elves no longer know Gladelion, knowing instead Court Common. (Replaces PHB Elvish).

**Khuzdul Zudûn**, Deeps Speech – the modern form of the ancient language and script of the Dwarves spoken throughout the Khozmad Deeps. Though they keep strongly to their traditions, the passing millennia and the cultural severing of the Shattering have made the old Dwarvish logographic inscriptions unintelligible to modern Deeps Speech and its syllabary, although it can yet be found on many of their temples, statues and reliefs. Old Dwarvish is a language lost to all but the most secretive and studious of archaeologists.

**Loghric** "Clans Common" – the language of the people of the lochs. Utterly alien to the Imperial Common of the rest of Mitteland, the clansmen are separated into half a hundred feuding groups, and half a hundred different dialects, with many refusing to understand the other on bloody principle.

### An Old Connection
The languages of Patrie du Pape and the Imperial counties of Ludorol and even more distant Damaran-Olistia are not so dissimilar. In fact, they hint at a near continuity, that perhaps they were neighbours of a sort in the lost days of Eden before shattering into shards. 

The scholars of language learned enough to notice this, however, are few indeed. 

### Gnomish and the Traveller's Tongue
Since the first days, the gnomes were spread out between the settlements and territories of other peoples, forever seeking the curiosities abundant in the world. Lacking the cohesion of a single culture, whatever language they may have kept to in the days of the Green Flight, long before even the Cataclysm, has been lost entirely to the history of time.

In Mitteland, the gnomes often travelled in caravans and merchant trains, and spoke the trader's tongue of the time. This creole developed over the ages into a full blown, and quite alien, language of its own from Imperial Common or Damarani. This Traveller's Tongue was spoken by the families and groups who kept to this lifestyle, even after the losses and hardships of the Age of Strife, and was taken up by the adopted Woaden along with a fair sprinkling of vocabulary and phrases of Gladéllion, who too took up the life of wandering, in the face of having no home and no other to call friend. The Traveller's Tongue is often native to the few remaining Gnomes, though they are so spread out they are oft to come from any of the cultures as they are of the travelling bands. Common folk often mistakenly assume the Traveller’s Tongue to be the gnomish language anyway, though any scholar would scoff at their ignorance.

### Draconic, Druidic and Exotic Languages
Exotic languages are exotic because they are rare, powerful and often magical, rendering them immune to the whims and changes of people, remaining unchanged as the millennia march ever onward. They are also often closely guarded secrets, and as such are difficult to learn due to lack of material and dearth of willing teachers. Druidic is perhaps the ur-example of this. Both the language of communion with the spirits of nature, and also a capital crime in all druid circles, without exception. Exotic languages are not considered cultural languages.

Draconic is of particular importance, for it is the language of those beings that represent magic itself; dragons. Draconic is then, perhaps ironically, the most well-known of the exotic languages, though exceedingly few are actually well enough versed in it to speak the language conversationally, instead many learn various words, phrases and rituals by rote. It is the language of spells, rituals and conjurations, and the basis upon which the Runes of the arcane, and the High Magic used to formulate new spells, are made from.

The dragonborn clans are all but gone, part of history's more bloody chapters. A few of the drake blood have managed to retain their traditions and family's enough to pass on the powerful tongue, but most of the survivors drift among the other cultures utterly ignorant of the fantastic and cursed legacy they are heirs of, speaking at best corrupted versions of the language that have lost all power, known as Draken.
