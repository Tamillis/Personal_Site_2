# Ihleiska Map

This is a map of the Many Kingdoms of Ihleiska, a hitherto backwater of Mitteland where only recently Imperial interests have waxed strongly with Stannis' New Army's ties.

Now a conflict of three ideologies rears as times are changing in the arboreal vallies of Ihleiska, known as the War for the Orcheart. Native beliefs vie with the Everlight faith while fiercely independent 'Kings' seek to retain their independence against Imperial influence, evenwhile ancient residents tussle amongst each other to dominate in this place filled to the brim with the old and forgotten, and now the very new.

## The Many Kingdoms of Ihleiska
Tuskmen and Men, and some Goliaths, Dwarves and Goblinoids too, have made small territories called kingdoms - though fiefs would be a better word given the size and often vassal like relations between them - in the alpine forests and cave-littered rough land of Ihleiska. These are often about honour, treasure and control, a foil to their ancestrial rage, and to show a king any less respect than he is due is a recipe to be slain in one-on-one combat where that rage is allowed to come out. A few small elven glades of truly wild elves, their own definition of fief and honour alien to the others, and fortified craggy shires of halflings further colour the fabric of this fractured land.

In the Northern Pass, the ancient Elónian and Czondazani built border wall stems the only open pass to this area and the west, between the northern tip of the Fold and the mercurial Misted Peaks that rise at the edge of the shard. Cupped to the south by the Spur mountain range and capped to the west by the Fold, bar the pass, and to the east by the humongous Rift, with the North being the ebbing and flowing mistal no-man's land; it's an arboreal and primeval place, into which the cultures, technologies and advancements of the west struggle to take root.

### Age of Wonder
After the Shattering and the breaking of the remaining roving Legions of Terror, their members were beaten back from the Heartlands and through the pass into Ihleiska. After hundreds of years beaten and abandoned the remnants of the Legions eventually grew cultures out of those free of, or able to throw off, the Curse of Gruumsh, and forged themselves in blood against those that could not. These settled into the Tuskmen honour kingdoms of today, as their rage subsided. In time those settlements, and the extremely hardy remaining settlements of the other races who survived both the Shattering and this migration, grew into the territorial quilt of polities seen ever since. Some of those reached outside the isolation of Ihleiska to make contact with those once ravaged in the Heartlands, eventually leading Iman z Hauttergeit to proclaim rulership over all the Ihleiska Kingdoms, though that claim was often ignored by the residents. 

During the Age of Wonder the west was slowly settled and colonized, primarily by “imperial” citizens now on the wrong side of favour, particularly nearby ever-discontent Czondazani, and many of the alpine valleys and mountain valleys have been cleared and painstakingly tilled into farmland in the south-west. Even after hundreds of years of ebb and flow settlement, the region still sees a general west-to-east increasing gradient of wilderness and danger. It doesn’t help that the humongous outpouring of mana from the Rift and the Mist wall empowers monstrosities in those general directions, and feral tribes still beholden to Gruumsh descend from the ancient valleys of the Spur to rape and reave. 

### Age of Strife and Age of Man
Curiously the Age of Strife mostly passed this region by, and generally business was as usual, if even more hands off from external influence, until a fanatical cult to Gruumsh managed to bewitch thousands of Tuskmen back into orcs and forming a new Legion that scoured the lands; especially the tilled lands of the west. Even today it bears the moniker “The Old Farmland”, as the new legion headed for the Heartlands it left behind it a depopulated arc that remains fairly feral to this day. Much of the Many Kingdoms of Ihleiska burned or were forcefully converted to the Ravager, and came to its crescendo as the King’s Fort was broken and then Tchernigow itself, the ancient fortress built by the Gods, was sacked. Finally, this new legion of terror was slain by the Rain of Glass in what came to be called the Crimson Wood as the legion gorged on eastern Czondazani lands and mired, the elves and men of the north fell on them with bitter hate.

In the Age of Man, the region of Ihleiska is one of Stannis’ cornerstone allies both martially and religiously, a turn of fortune and source of strength no-one in the Heartlands saw coming, and many wonder at how that initial alliance came about. Nevertheless, the fodder of the legions of terror, ancient and new, were made anew as the backbone of his New Army. He first used them to tame the river spirits, and then to break the backs of all the Sorcerer Kings and breakaway states. Orc meat marched in the front lines backed up by magi-tech industrial support, and they were coaxed into an intense pride to be the fist of the Second Empire, now augmented by regularised human war-wizards and bolstered by erstwhile rival hobgoblins, and blessed to be the poster boys of the new faith, as their Purified officers lead from the front.

### Geopolitics of Ihleiska
The intelligensia of the outside scoff at Ihleiska, saying it is well known for having more Kings than citizens, and that the “kingdoms” within are little more than fiefs and fields. Anyone within would never be so stupid to call the kings anything other than kings, and fail to give them or the hardy folk of the region the respect they are due.

One unfortunate consequence of this attitude is that few maps exist that actually map all the individual fiefs. They are many, dense, small and ever-changing, and not eve local maps can be relied on to be or remain accurate. On top of this is the simple fact that most kings owe fealty to others, forming many layers of vasalisation and pacts, further complicating the matter of influence exponentially. 

That said, Ihleiska can be broadly divided into the following regions and places of interest:

- **King’s Fort & The Army Lease** – the “fief” of the Imperial Army at the mouth of the old farmlands, which they use for training and army games, testing etc. Kept relatively depopulated in order to be used, though a few surrounding settlements are curated which function both as feeder settlements for supplies, as well as constant recruitment hubs.
- **The Old Farmlands** – primarily ruled by the confederation of the imperially aligned fiefs known simply as the “Confederation of Everlight Clans”, taking as they have the new religion as their point of commonality. Imperial support and this switch to a new way of organisation, putting the church and its head above local kings, has given them the edge to dominate much of the region and become the local great power. The local leadership is a balance between the Imperial Commander in advice Lord Fanebell (a halfling commander who has lost all cheer), the Everlight purified Bishop Beacon Glorius, the King Mezoek Ura to whom the other four “kings” of the confederation are nominal vassals, and the aggregate “Council of Elders” of all the elders and peers of the five fiefs (soon 6) that makeup the confederation.
- **The Many Kingdoms** / **Ihleiska Proper** - the central region home to the many kingdoms for which the region is known, just as complex and unknowable as one may expect. The line between the surrounding regions and this one is almost definitionally blurry
- **The Farpeak Vales** - a rise of mountains in the central north of the region, the tuskmen of the region are rumoured to be particularly adept at magic, and the region seems to focus around one particular valley.
- **Stormking’s Folley** - all that is left of a figure of distant legend is this valley that is home to a blue dragonborn clan.
- **Naenym Woods and other Glades** – an imperial neutral glade of wild elves, arguably the largest in the region. There are many more non-aligned glades of all sorts of sizes in Ihleiska making up some of the many kingdoms. This includes the Clans of Night Elves, a network of so-called surface dwelling drow and wild elf glades.
- **The Cold North** - vast open prairies interspersed with copses of firs, renowned for its long winters and bitter winds even in the summers, and for its herds of reindeer, bison and yaks, and the clans that herd them, that do well despite the cold and mistal predators.
- **Troll Country** - beware ye who venture here without preparation, for no troll brooks another, let alone one of the littler folk.
- **The Few Kingdoms** / **Yondervale** – the old far frontier, the curiously steady and distant mistwall to the north east has allowed this area to slowly develop over the ages, especially as they escaped untouched the New Legion.
- **The Spurmark Hinterlands** – far in the east, but south near the spur and the end of Spur’s High Castle, is a land populated long before the steady spread of Tuskmen from the west. Some native Spurmark Tuskmen also have settlements and fiefs, but mostly there are Hobgoblin holdfasts, dwarven fortresses, human riftsider towns and wild elf strider caravans.
- **The Untrodden East** – a mistal no man’s land, a vast empty part of the canvas. Or is it?

### The War for the Orcheart
The region has a word that can be roughly translated as 'the battleground for the orcheart', often simply reduced to the 'orcheart'. It is a local word meaning more along the lines of how a man (in particular a Tuskman but the idea and the word has spread to be used across racial borders) should live his life. The very existence of the kingdoms is based on the rejection of the old reavers of Gruumsh afterall, when the creation of the Edict finally allowed the orcs to throw off the yoke of their erstwhile constantly stoked rage under the Eyes of the Reaver, whereafter they then called themselves Tuskmen (given a few centuries to calm down, and be beaten back).

But even now many still roam not in settled fiefs, but caravans of pillagers and reapers, not sowing but merely taking. Those that actively indulge in their nature and yet worship Gruumsh not as a demon that cursed them, but as their God that Created them. This is one orcheart.

In stark contrast a religion of active pacifism, of cultivation of everything it means to instead be a humane person and not an animalistic reaver and reaper, came about, following the teachings and enlightenment of a Tuskman known as Muevelt Ember. The religion gained the name A’Koeveteeshe, and has highly recognisable members who bear turtle shells on their stomachs. They soon came to be a kind of priest-caste in many fiefs and at other times running isolated monastery settlement-fiefs of their own. Such is the orcheart, that the religion bred as many different sects as there are Kingdoms in the region. One aspect of the religion’s success is its emphasis on child rearing with child-care. They often run the creches / schools [though not a school like you or I might understand] of a fief; provide more children than most; and fill these young minds with their ideals.

Now, however, the religion of Stannis the Great, the Everlight, is making great headway as a third option, particularly in the army-dominated west and among the more martially inclined body politic of the region that cannot afford to be pacifists yet reject Gruumsh as many Tuskmen do. Gaining particular popularity is a sect of the Everlight that eventually culminates in its Tuskic members transforming into 'new men', the purified; skin-colour reset to the ochre of a human, build reduced, mind sharpened, eyes set from amber to brown-blue, and all changes inflicted by the curse of Gruumsh undone. The steps of this ritual are considered a state-secret, and many New Army officers are one of these new men.

### Orcish Remnants in The Spur
For all that the west is changing, the heights of the Spur in the southernmost portions of Ihleiska contain the last violent remnants of how the orcheart used to be: the bloody insatiate rage of Gruumsh. The Spur is haunted by these orc reavers, and only the most ardent of Hobgoblin holdfasts steak claims and hold the line.

The Spur is by far the oldest mountain range of the Mitteland Shard. Much older than the Fold, which was made during the Shattering, and though imperial geologists cannot be conclusive, most likely older than the Mid-South's Hole, and the distant peaks of the Harlem Plateau. Of the remaining wildernesses within reconquered imperial territory it is the least approchable. Ancient and unrecorded risks, and the presence of the orcish remnant, make it an unexplored place. Only the wild lands bordering the Mist approach the same level of uncivility (an inevitability). 

In the Spurs civilization can only be found by going down, into the deeps below and the clans of the An Kaismeachd Khada (The Long March), running from the northern fold all the way, though not continuously, to the Spurmark Hinterlands.
