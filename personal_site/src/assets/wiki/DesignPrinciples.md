# Design Principles of the Materium Existentiae 

The Materium Existentiae is a fleshed out and thoroughly realised fantasy realm that contains all of the best tropes and facets of high fantasy, designed primarily to include all of the implied base D&D setting hinted at in the official material, into a cohesive and unique whole that I hope you will enjoy exploring. One particular and highly developed region I often run in is known as Mitteland, where changing times and a turbulent history has set the stage for many an adventure.

The principles I created for my world are:

### Cohesiveness, Inclusiveness 

The implied world of D&D is played straight. Virtually all aspects of D&D and the world implied by its mechanics, snippets and flavour are integrated into a cohesive and extensive whole, and an in-world explanation exists for all of its various idiosyncrasies (such as hit points, or not-quite-vancian magic), even if it isn’t present and obvious to most of the characters or peoples of the world.  

To avoid the apparent randomness and arbitrariness of kitchen sink fantasy, the various powers and plethora of races and options are in various ways attempted to be explained by unifying forces and history where possible. Even so options will seem vast, but at the same time this vastness can instead now be used as a strength. Additionally many options can be distributed between the Shards. Each shard will have recommended races, backgrounds and classes/subclasses thereby creating a home for the massive list of choices available (especially if you include homebrew). Everything in can have its place.  

### Related Racial Origins, The First Men

Following the idea of unification and inclusiveness, the fate of the First Men, the first peoples created by the Creator Gods at the beginning of the Age of Eden, shaped the majority of the races today through a series of descendants, called Bloodlines, and adaptations. Ancient and legendary, the "First Men" were three; the titan, the man and the little one. The titan would strive forth, did things first, alone, and, depending on the nature of the tale, perfectly and/or arrogantly. Around this, Man and Little one bonded to do the tasks they couldn’t do alone, a relationship that lasts to this day called the "first fast friendship".

The other races are later interventions onto these three peoples, or inventions, of the Gods, mimicking the first creations. These include the Beast races (those made by the awakening of a beast or the fusion of a man and a beast, such as tortles and aarakockra in the former and centaurs and yuanti in the latter), the goblins and the dwarves. 

This is also a point of theological contention. Aren’t those made First righteous? Aren’t those refined by the Gods sacred? Many Shards struggle to overcome the differences between these peoples.

### Grounded Mechanics
As part of cohesiveness, the classes, levels, features and other mechanics are integrated and “explained” in Universe. The many character features, special powers, detailed in the PHB and other books are indeed learnable in-world abilities, meaning anyone with the capability should be, and are, able to learn them, even if they run off fantasy laws of nature & magic. Conversely this means all features must *be* explainable with in-world fantasy laws of nature & magic.

For example; the concept of life force accounts for the weirdness that is HP discrepancies between different levels & classes and their thematic presentation. Higher level people, as it were, can straight up take more damage and are hardier than lower levels. The stuff of their being is more tightly bound by the strength of their life force. Consequently the concept of "powerlevel" is a known and (somewhat) measurable fact, without being a literal game. Lifeforce, Mana Magnitude and other consequences matter to the peoples of this world.  

The power of classes and their features, then, comes from the various power sources accessible in the world. Psychic powers is life force projected, with ki being life force channelled within. Certain darker, deadlier forces could channel black anima (a sort of anti-life force). Magic is accessed through weaves of arcane power learned through arcane study and fixed to the caster. Many carry boons of the Gods, the environment, or beyond. And many, in combination with born, learned and trained abilities, are just being a bad-ass (barbarian, fighter, rogue). 

### Universal Force of Magic 

Grounded Mechanics give rise to Magic & Mana existing as a principle force. Magic and mana lead to the creation of spells and their effects as seen in the PHB and further afield (including homebrew spells and magic). Similarly, published and approved spells leads to truths about the true nature of magic and mana, a true singular nature which exists under it all. A "Universal Force of Magic", even if no in-world scholar has a unifying theory. Yet.  

### In-Verse Purpose, The Cycle of Thought 

The inhabitants of this world know of a concept called by the priest castes across all Shards as "The Cycle of Thought". They say, the cosmos had a start and a story as well as a purpose, and it will have an end. That each soul undergoes "The Journey of Ideas", from birth to life to death and to judgement, and finally to return back to the beginning so that a new soul can be born again. This is the Cycle of Thought, and it shapes the cosmos, which can be said to shape itself. The process of the Cycle of Thought is its raison d’etre. 

What will be the final form of purpose? Is there such a thing as an end to purpose? Who or what goes against that?

### Marred by Gods, Made by the Shattering 

The Gods are real, and they are the reason much of the world is the way it is. The Gods are real. Think about the overwhelming effect that has, on the world and the people that inhabit it. Does coincidence even exist any more? (Yes, it just becomes a very difficult thing to call, and a point of theological contention for those that follow trickster gods). And so this is a world shaped by Gods right down to the Shattering and the sealing away of them from the physical world with the Edict. The real question becomes, what matters an absent God? 

Sealed Gods are not bound, they still effect the world, instead now through boons and commands to their loyal followers on the Shards. And never forgot, to them your soul goes upon death.

The Shattering, the event that made the Shards themselves through the destruction of Eden, paradise on the Material, and the Edict greatly shape the current physical world and inform all its histories, peoples and cultures. 

This setup of the Shards drifting among deadly Mist, is my twist on traditional D&D worlds, and the reason I hope it has an identity.   

### Orthogonal (& Interesting) Axes of Alignment 

The Cosmos is separated into three clear and distinct axes that don’t overlap; the axis of morals, the axis of desire and the axis of choice, and they are a very real, core part of the cycle of thought and the cosmos. They’re important to the nature of man and deeply effect how all behave in all aspects of the world. 

It came about because I find the 9x9 traditional system of D&D to be broken. Primarily because it is poorly defined and understood by its players. I'm sure its designers could wax lyrical, but in the many games I've been in, the system breaks down, and I think its telling that so many tables, and now D&D itself, choose to ignore it. 

What is good? What is law? Who decides? The way they’re described are often contradictory, conflated or nonsensical on further reflection, or just boringly waved away as “whatever the Gods say” which takes away from the real chance of exploring the dynamics of inherent good and evil, law and chaos. 

So they have been reworked to tackle themes I find interesting and should be interesting to explore; my three axes. These are supposed to be orthogonal, what one is doesn't matter at all about the state of the other two. They follow the themes; 
- benefit vs harm (i.e. classic good vs evil for a consequentialist) - the axis of morals, i.e. what
- long-term group oriented goals ("rational") vs short term satisfaction of individual/in-group goals ("instinct") - the axis of desire, i.e. why
- spontaneity vs systematic approach (chaos vs law) - the axis of choice, i.e. how
 
Neutrality is the null stance and need not be stated.  

Individuals can and do define themselves as adherents to a particular path or paths, or place themselves on a scale for each of these axes, and as any mortal knows, they can be "corrupted" or "saved" and move along them. Only the Palace of Memories will decide, upon death and judgement, where they fall and to where they will be sent.
