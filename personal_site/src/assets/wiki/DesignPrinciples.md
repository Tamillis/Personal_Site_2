# Design Principles of the Materium Existentiae 

The Materium Existentiae is a fleshed out and thoroughly realised fantasy realm that contains all of the best tropes and facets of high fantasy, designed primarily to include all of the implied base D&D setting hinted at in the official material, into a cohesive and unique whole that I hope you will enjoy exploring. One particular region I often run in is known as Mitteland, where changing times and a turbulent history has set the stage for many an adventure.

The other principles I created for my world are:

### Cohesiveness, Inclusiveness 

The implied world of D&D is played straight. Virtually all aspects of D&D and the world implied by its mechanics, snippets and flavour are integrated into a cohesive and extensive whole, and an in-world explanation exists for all of its various idiosyncrasies, even if it isn’t present and obvious to most of the characters or peoples of the world.  

To avoid the apparent randomness and arbitrariness of kitchen sink fantasy the various powers and plethora of races and options are in various ways attempted to be explained by unifying forces and history. Even so options will seem vast, but at the same time this vastness can be instead used as a strength. Each shard can have recommended backgrounds and classes/subclasses thereby creating a home for the massive choices available (especially including homebrew) with everything having a place.  

### Orthogonal (& Interesting) Axes of Alignment 

The Cosmos is separated into three clear and distinct axes that don’t overlap; moral, desire and choice, and they are a very real, core part of the cycle of thought. They’re important to the fabric of the universe and deeply effect all aspects of the world. The 9x9 system is broken because it is poorly defined and understood. What is good? What is law? Who decides? The way they’re described are often contradictory, conflated or nonsensical on further reflection, or just boringly waved away as “The Gods say so” which takes away from the real chance of exploring the dynamics of actual good and evil, law and chaos, reason and passion. 

So they have been reworked to tackle themes I find interesting and should be interesting to explore; the three axes. These intendedly orthogonal themes are; benefiting / constructive (not-harm) vs harm / destructive (i.e. classic good vs evil), long-term satisfaction for inclusive group collectivism and their goals vs short term satisfaction of individuals and exclusive groups and their goals (reason vs passion)*, and judging moment by moment and spontaneity vs ordered systemised structure to attain goals (chaos vs logic). They express; the why, the what, and the how. Neutrality is the null stance and need not be stated.  

*this is the most poorly defined, as it is clearly two ideas slammed together. It’s a matter of ingroup scope and short term vs long term indulgence weights. Drop the scope? Passions tend to in groups and reason to inclusivity but let short term desires and long term plans be the axis. Instinct vs reason.

### Marred by Gods, Made by the Shattering 

The Gods are real, and they are the reason much of the world is the way it is. The Gods are real. Think about the overwhelming effect that has, on the world and the people that inhabit it. Does coincidence even exist any more? (Yes, obviously, it just becomes a very difficult thing to call, and a point of theological contention). And so this is a world shaped by Gods right down to the Shattering and the sealing away of the Gods from the Material with the Edict. The real question becomes, what is an absent God? 

The Shattering and the Edict greatly shape the material world and inform its histories, peoples and cultures, and The Shards and Mists continue to shape them today. In the D&D universe this is my new addition, and the reason it has an identity.   

### Related Racial Origins (if obscured) to the Three First Men 

The fate of the First Men shaped the majority of the races today through a series of descendants called Bloodlines.  

The others are later interventions, or inventions, of the Gods, mimicking the first creations. These include the Beast races (those made by the awakening of a beast or the fusion of a man and a beast, such as tortles and aarakockra in the former and centaurs and yuanti in the latter), the goblins and the dwarves. This is also a point of theological contention. Aren’t those made First righteous? Aren’t those touched by the Gods sacred?

### In-Verse Purpose, The Cycle of Thought 

The cosmos has a start and a story as well as a purpose. The Journey of Ideas, the Cycle of Thought, shapes the cosmos, which shapes itself, and can be said to be its raison d’etre. What will be the final form of purpose? Is there such a thing as an end to purpose?

### Universal Force of Magic 

Magic & Mana exists as a principle force, and leads to the creation of spells and their effects as seen in the PHB and further afield (as well as homebrew), and the former leads to the latter. Facts about spells can be used to infer the true nature of magic and mana, a true nature which exists.  

### Grounded Mechanics
The classes, levels, features and other mechanics are integrated and “explained” in Universe. The features are learnable abilities (meaning anyone with the capability should be, and are, able to learn them) even if they run off fantasy laws of nature & magic.  

For example; life force accounts for the weirdness that is HP discrepancies between different levels & classes and their thematic presentation. Higher level people can straight up take more damage and are hardier than lower levels. Consequently the concept of powerlevel is a known and (somewhat) measurable fact, without being a “game”. Lifeforce and Mana Magnitude matter to the peoples of this world.  

Classes and their features come from the various power sources accessible in the world (psychic (life force projected), ki (life force within), black anima (anti-life force), weaves of arcane power accessed through arcane study, boons of the Gods, various phenomenon of the environment) in combination with born, learned and trained abilities, or by just being a bad-ass (barbarian, fighter, rogue).
