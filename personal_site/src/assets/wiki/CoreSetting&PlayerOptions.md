This document contains background information for the setting of the Materium Existentiae, a fleshed out and thoroughly realised fantasy realm that contains all of the best tropes and facets of high fantasy, including all of the implied base D&D setting, in a cohesive and unique whole that I hope you will enjoy exploring. Included is one particular region known as Mitteland, where changing times and a turbulent history set the stage for many an adventure. 

The majority of this document details the races of the Materium Existentiae and their place in the shards, including new player options. Before this are some unique backgrounds for the setting, and unique feats that complement the setting and the style of play found at my table.

Specific shards within the Existentiae may or may not have all of the following races or backgrounds, and often have specific faction-derived backgrounds and options; or may even include new additions to the roster entirely. Check your player brief for such information, or ask me.

## The Core Setting
### Materiae
> “I have seen a map of it. Of Eden. Of the world before it was broken in spite. It was vast, oh so vast! And all we have left is a glittering yet meagre chain of jewels shining in the last of Pelor’s blessing. Oh! Wherefore such madness, ancestors!?”
> 
>  – High Seer of the Guild of Diviners in the New Academy, Capital.

What remains of the material plane is known as the Materium Existentiae. They are drifting constellations of massive earthen shards that have since been rediscovered after The Shattering, the event lost to ancient history that tore the Material Plane asunder. 

Each shard is a world unto itself, sometimes large, sometimes as small as a single village; a chunk of earth adrift in the Mists. The Mists are the roiling terrifying energies of the once calm Astral Sea that now flows around these shards, each of which is formally known as a Materia. In modern times navigator captain-magi pull upon powerful magics and devices to propel their vessels, often known as Warping Ships, through the Mists to venture into new lands, though such capabilities are rare, poorly understood and always treacherous. 

Some Materiae know nothing of such powers, and believe the rest of the world is lost to what they often call The Cataclysm, and nought but their island of sanity is left amongst a grey sea of madness. If indeed, such legends of other worlds remain at all.

Materiae vary vastly from one to the next. Size, diversity, lethality and beauty are some of the many ways in which the Materium Existentiae can be differentiated. Denizens also mark the various shards as different. Some races are rather ubiquitous across the shards; sometimes due to their magical nature enabling them to travel freely, but more commonly due to pure promiscuity pre-Shattering; leaving settlements and peoples all over to reseed the broken earth. Many others can only be found on certain specific shards, trapped in a cage they can barely conceive.

### The Empire of Mitteland
> “His Royal Highness, the Emperor Iman Z Hauttergeit; Emperor of all Mitteland and her colonies, King of Elóna, Damaran, Čondazan, and Nybor, High King of the Ihleiskas, High Ruler of the Barrows and Shires, Lord-Kar of the Halls of the Khozmad Deeps, Prime Keeper of the Glades of Maeryn, Ghelron, Vensi and Hus, Duke of High Castle and Sovereign of the Ironshore.”
> 
>  – Iman Z Hauttergeit’s titles during the greatest extent of the First Empire.

One Materia of great importance is the Empire of Mitteland, no matter which part of history you examine. This immense shard, rivalled only in size by the other two known Great Materiae, as they’re called, is dominated by the Empire to which it gives its name. Split into 4 rough regions across two mountain ranges and an immense rift, the three kingdoms, many duchies, dozens of cities and countless factions and peoples carve the world around them with their might, in their own shard as well as extra-mistal, boasting at one time the greatest multi-shard empire history has seen. 

Like any shard, the history of the Empire starts with the Shattering, and how that catastrophic chaos, loss of life, mass displacement and reshaping of the lands set the stage for the future. The early history of the shard saw the formation of the three kingdoms that would form the core of the Empire, the casting of the bronze rune throne, and the rise to rulership of Elona over the other two kingdoms. This culminated in the First Empire, whose main objective was the consolidation of all power in the shard. This goal rapidly shifted when the first mist-going vessels made their appearance, and the seas opened up to other horizons entirely, and a rapid colonisation and empire-building push occurred, that also brought unprecedented wealth and knowledge to the home shard. 

However, this did put the empire on a fighting stance with another great power that it had encountered, the Kingdom of White and Blue of the Great Materia Patrie du Pape. These two greats were soon in a cold war that in time turned hot. The climax of that conflict being the Godfall, an event that physically and spiritually smashed both states. 

This ushered in the era of the so called “Sorcerer Kings” and the Age of Strife where the chaotic aftermath fractured both states into warring fiefdoms ruled by individuals of immense personal power, magical and mundane, which was only recently resolved. During the Strife magic and spirit went under the knife, anything to gain an advantage against fellow sorcerer kings in a land roiling with celestial horrors, and with that knowledge the Age of Man manifested at a bloody and moral cost. It took its most iconic shape in the form of the New Army of Stannis Hauttergeit, the Emperor of the newly declared Second Empire; he who reunited Mitteland, with politics and a whole lot of well-directed force, and put an end to the age of strife and self-rule. The Empire is back, but on a bloody and uncertain footing, and those that would wield magic recklessly are hunted down. This is a world wary of magic, so prevalent and powerful had it become. 

### The Eternal Calm
> “Just think of home sailor, the warmth of your bed, the smell of the bakery, the feel of your girl. That’ll bring us there all the sooner”
> 
>  – Navigator Bradwain, of the warping vessel Eranille. 

An endless calm sea, lit not by the Sun, but by a thousand-thousand bright stars, sits somewhere beyond the physical realm and the dreaded Mists. Though many have tried to find its bounds, none have succeeded in doing so. Its sky is bright enough to colour the calm in dark blues and purples of the morning or evening, though these stars don’t shift, and the perpetual dusk-dawn lingers. 

Due to some cosmic quirk, travel into and out of the Calm for warping ships is relatively easy once within the Mists, and so it is often used as a far safer thoroughfare when travelling, using the lost Moons and pearlescent stars as navigation to find their destinations instead of braving long, dangerous and blind journeys through the grey.

Nevertheless, it is a place apart from the material, with its fair share of oddities, quirks and dangers. Denizens from other realms can slip their bounds and settle in its shallows. Rumours abound of settlements on the astral reefs, and the non-Euclidean geography can bend minds and run ships aground. The disconnected nature often also rends certain powers removed or altered in curious ways, including the entirety of the ethereal plane and those that rely on it.

### The Mists
> “Beware the mists, oh little one. Lest all your wits, be took and gone.” 
> 
>  – Gnomish proverb, spoken from mother to child over the ages.

The mists are the wreathing remains of an Astral Sea, sundered and churned into a roiling magical maelstrom. It has become the embodiment of corruptive force, and it surges between the shards of the Materiae, gnawing at and warping their boundaries, regurgitating madness when it ebbs. 

Mist creeps upon the edges of the Materiae, sometimes up close as a boiling wall of madness that devours and corrupts kilometres of earth in ebbs and flows, revealing chaotic borderlands; sometimes far below and far away, a distant and safe-seeming hazard that rises and falls at the bottom of comfortably tall cliffs. Sometimes it’s gone entirely, and nothing but the Calm remains.

The reason for the fear and the danger is twofold. Things come out of the mists. Twisted things, often of great size and strength, beasts of other shards warped and fed by corrosive energies; or true outsiders of inimical intent, looming out to drag victims into the grey madness, oft spined and betentacled, their alien minds as corrupted as their bodies. The other is the reality bending effect it has on the lands and seas that border it, and the creatures that brush against it. Settling too near Mists is utter madness, for it ebbs and flows to strange unpredictable tides, and any place that falls into the Mists and later revealed is never the same again. Sometimes such settlements reappear empty and unharmed, as if all the folk had simply left, other times a nightmarish jungle stands where a town once did, ancient ruins the only sign, and out of it pours ghouls and ghosts to haunt the nightmares of those nearby. Sometimes, great magics and treasures are left behind from an age when Gods strode the earth, and the lucky finders are enriched for it. 

These ebbs and flows usually vary the Mist wall by a few dozen miles over the period of a month or two, but the Mists defy logic, and sometimes they surge forward or rush back, and blanket a hundred miles of untouched land in astral madness, or withdraw for a century to reveal a fresh land of wonder and treasure. Temporary settlements often crop up where the Mists seem to withdraw, populated by daredevil adventurers, or the merely desperate, and those that service and outfit them, seeking to dive into former Mist territory, make some great discovery, and earn their fame and fortune. These opportunists are known as mistdivers, and versions of them are found many shards over. 

## Backgrounds

### Mistdiver
> “You wanna know how I got these mouths?”
> 
>  – Gee “Smiles” McCackle, member of the mistdiver guild Opportunity Knocks

You were an opportunist, an individual of great ambition or foolish confidence, that saw the horrors of the Mists and the inherent unknown in the things it leaves behind as tomorrow’s paycheque. You dove into the lands that bordered the Mist wall after it ebbed back to find what plunder you could, and fight or avoid the creatures and monstrosities the Mist had tainted or left behind. Inevitably at one point the Mist tainted you too, and most mistdivers say no diver is blooded until they gain their first taint.

**Skill Proficiencies**: Investigation, Perception

**Tool Proficiencies**: Navigator’s Tools, Thief’s Tools

**Equipment**: A set of navigator’s tools, 5 lock picks, a trinket from your first dive, a set of traveller's clothes, a pouch containing 5gp.
 
**Feature**: *Minor Mutation*
You have a small mutation that marks you as touched by the Mists. Those outside of the mistdiver community will look at you with suspicion and fear if you reveal it, believing you could be one of the very monstrosities they have been warned about since childhood. However, your mutation may aid you in ways you might not expect, and you find yourself far more resistant to further mutation. Work with your GM to determine your mutation and its potential uses and effects.

d8|Example Mutation|Potential Effects
---|---|---
1|Third ear mounted on the forehead.| Your third ear allows you more sensitive hearing.
2|Third arm on one side of the torso.|An extra arm and hand to make use of.
3|Hair turned into wreathing eels.|A slippery advantage in brawls that needs to be kept hydrated.
4|Digitigrade Legs|Feet that have been overly extended and changed your manner of locomotion.
5|5ft tongue|Your tongue can unfurl from the mouth like a fleshy prehensile appendage.
6|Split-blood Face|The left half of your face is now that of a Tiefling (or human if already Tiefling)
7|Holey Nose|Your nose is now entirely missing, leaving a gaping hole where it once was.
8|Tail|A long tail sprouts from the base of your spine, granting balance.

### Mage Hunter
> "It was men like you who brought the Empire and its people to it's knees. Now I will bring you to yours." 
> 
> – The Marquis Bertholdt Von Komreig, licensed mage hunter

The age of sorcerer kings and rampant planar beings birthed innumerable tragedies that instilled in people a fear of magic, exaggerated by its systemisation and spread. As control of magi became a greater and greater concern, those who would hunt down rogue magic users appeared to fill the need. Desperados, bounty hunters, ex-soldiers and other such hardened folk, like you, took up the mantle; people paid to tag & bag rogue mages. 

**Feature**: *Mage Hunter’s Creed*
When dealing with hostile magic users all hunters learn various protocols for dealing with the vast and dangerous abilities of magic. You are always able to prepare for specific magics you face in your travels; be that through acquirement of equipment, use of special potions, or even employing magical items yourself. You know where to go to do that preparation or who to ask. When faced with novel hostile magics, you know where to turn to learn better protocols.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Athletics

**Tool Proficiencies:** Hunter’s Tools, Land Vehicles

**Equipment:** A bear trap, a gag & manacles, a Mage Hunter’s papers, a lucky charm, a set of traveller's clothes, a pouch containing 10gp.

## Feats

The following are feats characters can take that are present in the world of the Materium Existentiae. 

### Mana Filtering

**Prerequisites**; the ability to cast spells

Increase one of your spellcasting ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma, if you have multiple kinds of spellcasting) by 1 to a maximum of 20.

You can spend a minute concentrating to identify the Magnitude (0 to 9) and Mixture (proportion of red, green, blue, black and white) of ambient mana or the mana of a willing or unconscious creature you are touching.

When you know the mixture of ambient mana you can attune your personal mana to it once per day when you finish a short rest, choosing expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than the ambient mana magnitude, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. Alternatively, as an action, you can siphon a number of spell-slots which total your proficiency bonus from a willing or unconscious creature. If the target does not have sufficient spell slots of their own, they suffer one level of exhaustion, otherwise they lose those slots as if spending them on a spell.

You can store a spell slot into a heart stone up to the heart’s stone’s spell level as an action, and draw a spell slot from a heart stone as an action, if you have an expended spell slot of that level or higher.

### Mounted Archery

You are an expert at working from horse (or other) back and can make even the most treacherous of footings secure enough for your purposes. You gain the following benefits;
- You increase your Dexterity score by 1 to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.
- You no longer suffer from the effects of an unstable platform.
- You can mount or dismount as part of an attack action

### Weave Sight

**Prerequisites**; the ability to cast 3rd level spells

Increase your Intelligence by 1 to a maximum of 20.

You can take an intelligence (arcana) check as an action to identify any arcane spells (those available on the bard, sorcerer, warlock or wizard spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or known.

You can take an intelligence (religion) check as an action to identify any divine spells (those available on the cleric or paladin spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or knows.

You can take an intelligence (nature) check as an action to identify any nature spells (those available on the druid or ranger spell lists) a target creature you can see up to 60ft away has prepared or knows.

The difficulty for these checks is the target’s spell save DC. Each target can only be targeted once per day, no matter which check was used or whether it was successful or not. If a target knows no spells of the list checked the action is spent learning that information.

## Player Races
### Humans and Humanity

> “I enjoy watching humans. They are like ants. They are so earnest and try so hard, and yet most of it is trivial and meaningless, just like them.”
> 
>  – The Ancient Red Dragon that roosts on Godthroat, as interviewed by Beedle the Bard (allegedly).

Humanity is well represented across the Materiae. Every tribe and society, even including most of the minor shards and drifting isles, is home to at least a few humans. Just like in many worlds, materiae, and realms, humans represent the best and worst of civilization, and every other part of the spectrum, and are known primarily for their short lives, industriousness, and their lasting institutions.

That they are productive, conscientious, and promiscuous is without doubt, for human nations rule much of all the known Materiae, and even in wild and primal Tlancayo the greatest tribal territories and nations are governed, at least partially, by a human hand. They're everywhere, doing everything.

But “Humanity” is not a term usually used to mean the modern human race alone. Any and all of the races that descend from the First Men fall under the umbrella of humanity, be they a “touched” bloodline or descendant race. Even the haughty and capricious Eladrin, dwellers and custodians of the Fae Wyld, acknowledge this origin.

Humans, modern humans, are said by some to be the purest and most direct descendant of the First Men. The Religion of the Father, and the successor faith, the Everlight, both preach this as fact and unalienable right. Others say that humans are just as corrupted from the First Men as any of the other bloodlines, as they are not capable of the feats the First Men were described as accomplishing, and that instead the Humans are watered down pale shadows of the progenitors and those with blood at least have a bit of colour to their outline.

Regardless, it is an academic fact that humanity covers not just the Human race, but also all the touched and descended races of Elves, Half Elves, Dragonborn, Tieflings, Ásar, Harpies, Djinnis and so on, for they are treated by cosmology and the weave as parts of one greater whole.

The counterpoint to Humanity and the First Men are The Little Peoples, the pint-sized allies at their side since the first legends, who are often also often covered by the term "Humanity", though scholars note so as erroneously.

Humans can be found in the *Player Handbook*.

### The Touched and The Bloodlines

> “The half-elf cased the joint with a knowing eye, taking in the various patrons. There were many, but he knew the regulars and so knew to avoid them. Instead, he drifted over to a table of sailor-looking folk who had started a game of poker, and gracefully sat himself uninvited into an empty seat. He dropped his hood, and let his good looks and charm shine out like the dawning of the sun.”
> 
>  – excerpt from the popular penny-dreadful “The Heroics of Finn the Fabulous”.

In the beginning, there were the First Men, and they were pure and perfect, stepping out of the image of the Creator Sendum whole and complete, when The Three breathed life upon the worlds. And then the various powers and fundamentals from beyond the material cradle reached in and twisted and warped them, and so the first Touched were made. Yet other lost children left the safety of the cradle to dwell in corrupted places, and were in turn made corrupt. Or so say the preachers the Church of the Everlight.

The Touched are a people infused (or tainted, depending on who you ask) with some extra-materiae power, something that wrestles nature’s course into a new and different form. How exactly a family is Touched can vary, and indeed there are tales of all sorts of methods and results. Some come from long heritages and tribes whose Touched “bloodlines” are the foundation of their group. Some dynastic houses take certain pains to infuse their progeny with a specific touch. Sometimes individuals fell prey to a momentous event, and walked away permanently changed.

The Touched are said to have “the blood”, and as such perpetuate bloodlines. These powers and traits most often pass naturally from parent to child. This is not, however, a guaranteed thing, especially for the more chaotic or momentous powers. Two parents with the same bloodline might bring about completely normal, "baseline", human or halfling children. Sometimes some marker is carried from baseline parent to baseline child until in one generation it suddenly manifests again.

As such, it may be that a Tiefling belongs to a long and prideful line of Tieflings, with the original sin of demon cavorting being long behind them. It could be that an Ásar was in fact born a normal woman, until they were visited by the Gods one fateful day and they walked away celestially charged. It could be that an expecting human couple were quite surprised on the special day, when their son had blue skin, webbed toes and feet, and burbled happily at them in Aquan.

One of the most common and well known of these lines are the Fey Touched, the Half Elves, those of the green blood. These people have had their bloodline meddled by fey powers, and bare resemblance to the folk that hail from there. Ever since the green flight, they’ve become a fairly common member of many a shard. The four elements sometimes reach out to fill a soul to embody them, creating a Djinn. Other common bloodlines include the red blood of Hedonia, and the white blood of Forum. Those moulded by Mechanicus may find themselves entirely Reforged. Reflecting the everchanging nature of The Warp and its chaos, the Changelings never settle on a single form.

Half-Elves and Tieflings can be found in the *Player’s Handbook*, Ásar (Aasimar) in *Volo’s Guide to Monsters*, and Djinn (Genasi) in *Elemental Evil Player’s Companion*. Reforged can be found in the *Wayfarer’s Guide to Eberron* as Warforged, as can the Changelings.

### The Little Peoples

> “I swear, if that Tomberline sends us one more cask of soured wine, I will blow my top at him, I will! He’s more useless than the Copperbottoms!”
> 
>  – Killian Gippershod, leader of festivities in Barrowshire, in a letter to the organizer of festivities in Barrowshire.

Humans call them Halflings, but they call themselves “The Little People” in their own language. Their origins are much of a mystery, though they seem to be pretty ubiquitous, sometimes more so even than humans, with whom they have been working hand in hand with since before the Shattering and perhaps even from the beginning of time itself, oft retold in the household tale of “The First Fast Friendship”. Little Peoples too can be found across the shards, of course, making up members of tribes, villages and cities throughout the whole of the Materiae. The one little-known exception is The Shard of Three Isles, where they are mysteriously and curiously absent. 

Often times Halfling societies are uniformly Halfling, peaceful shires of little round houses and pleasant gardens, but not necessarily. The little dudes are also often found underfoot in the cities and towns of the world, making significant minorities or majorities in settlements and tribes the shards over, with families forming districts within cities where the building regulations tend to fit a smaller clientele.

Gnomes are to Halflings as the Elves are to Humans. Also known as Little People, they were just as ubiquitous as their cousins, if not more so, before inevitably dwindling in numbers. They too form strong extended family bonds, but otherwise eschew their cousin’s tendencies to form burrows and settlements, or settlement of any kind at all really. Gnomes are infected with the desire to be where the action is, and follow the other races to see what's going on, and ever since leaving the Fractal Dream, they fall prey to a sickness or palsy if they can't sate their curiosity.

They are particularly present at the borders between peoples where, as they see it, the fun really is. That gnomish curiosity has a twofold tragic downside though. Often, they are caught in many a crossfire between conflicting groups, distrusted as travellers, foreigners and potential spies. Secondly, many of them fall into what others call “Mist Madness”. This almost uncontrollable wanderlust takes over when at the Mistal breaches, and few Gnomes can stare at that ever-changing fractal joy and not be taken by the desire to walk deep within it. Most are never seen again. Of the very few who return from such an investigation, they are inevitably changed, often hailing from different materiae. And times. 

Halflings and Gnomes can be found in the *Player Handbook*.

 

#### **Mist Mad** (Gnome Subrace):

Many Gnomes are cautioned to avoid the Mists at all costs, and many heed those wise words. Those that don’t are often doomed to be hypnotized by the Mist’s Maddening swirls, and be drawn deep within. Those that survive are inevitably deeply changed, and far from home.

**Age** – unknown, time flows curiously in the Mists and those that can bare its touch often flow through time quite curiously themselves.

**Ability Score increase** – you increase one ability of your choice except intelligence by 1, according to your Major Mutations

**Major Mutations** – you have several major mutations warping and twisting your body in many locations, which have a collective effect. The effect of these mutations is not only to make you look like the horror that peasants tell tales of to frighten their children, enough to even make Mistdivers flinch at your visage, but one of the following;
- **Bulging Skin-Bursting Muscles** – you ignore the heavy property of weapons, you gain proficiency in Athletics, and your Strength score is increased by 1
- **Pawed digitigrade Hoof and Tail** – your movement speed is now 35ft, you gain proficiency in Acrobatics, and your Dexterity score is increased by 1
- **Armoured Shell and Scales** – your base AC when not wearing armour is 15 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number), you are resistant to Slashing damage, and your Constitution score is increased by 1.
- **Headful of Mismatched Eyes** – your passive perception is increased by 5, you gain proficiency in Perception, and your Wisdom score is increased by 1.
- **Hypnotic Bioluminescence** – you know the Friends cantrip, using your Charisma to cast the spell, you gain proficiency in Persuasion, and your Charisma score is increased by 1

**Everchanging Nature** – You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Absorb Elements spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Alter Self spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. 



#### **Wyldhand** (Halfling Subrace)

Gnomes are often called Fey Halflings, for their similar relationship that the Elves have with Humans, and whilst rather uncommon, one can find a Wyldhand Halfling, if they search hard enough.

**Ability Score Increase** – Your Wisdom score increases by 1

**Keen Senses** – You are proficient in the Perception skill.

**Fey Ancestry** – You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Like the Little People can be subject to the Fae Touch, so too can they be subject to the demonic and other bloodlines too, though they are exceedingly rare thanks to their tendency to not venture beyond their burrows. These halflings of the demon blood are known as the Impmen (Tiefling Variant, see below) and those of the white blood are known as the Ásarlings (Aasimar Variant, see below).

#### **Impmen**; (Tiefling variant)

**Ability Score Increase** – Your Dexterity score increases by 1 and your Charisma score increases by 2

**Age** – Impmen mature at the same rate as halflings, and can live for 250 years.

**Alignment** – Impmen might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them over indulge and end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many impmen toward a chaotic and passionate alignment.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 25ft 

**Darkvision** – thanks to your outsider heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Hellish Resistance** – you have resistance to fire damage.

**Devilish Luck** – When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Halfling Nimbleness** – You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**Languages** – You can speak, read and write Common, Infernal, and Halfling

#### **Ásarlings**; (Aasimar variant)

**Ability Score Increase** – your Charisma score increases by 2

**Age** – Ásarlings mature at the same rate as halflings, and can live up to 250 years.

**Alignment** – imbued with celestial power, most Ásarlings are good. Fallen Ásarlings are most often neutral or even evil.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 25ft 

**Darkvision** – thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Healing Hands** – as an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Brave** – you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Celestial Resistance** – you have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

**Languages** – you can speak, read and write Common, Halfling and Celestial

**Subrace** – three subraces of Ásarlings exist (chosen from the Aasimar subraces): protector, scourge, and fallen. Choose one of them for your character from Volo’s Guide to Monsters.

Other Little People bloodlines are rare, but they exist. When making a character from one of these bloodlines, take the base statistics for that race, and change the size to Small and the base walking speed to 25ft. In addition, they know the language Halfling, or its cultural equivalent in that shard. With your DM’s permission you may swap out a number of the base race’s traits in order to gain the halfling traits of Brave, Lucky and/or Nimbleness.

### The Fae
> “She sang, and the songbirds fell silent. She sang, and the wind ceased its moaning. She sang, and the shard stopped turning. I have never heard such singing. Such Art. I never shall again.”
> 
> – Ymungundr the Earless, shortly before he earned his name.

Long before the sundering of the world, some First Men and Little Peoples were trapped in the Fey Wilds, or perhaps journeyed there of their own accord. Once they left (or were ejected, the legends are unclear) they came into a new name; Elves and Gnomes. They bear a stark physical resemblance to their counterpart races, yet an often utterly alien countenance shaped by the waking and fractal dream that is the Fey Wild.

Regardless of their precise origins, they generally took to one of two paths once they returned to the material world; the primal way of life, living in the forests and maintaining great glades of beautiful, dangerous nature; or they were attracted to the intrigue and games of the mortals’ cities, the courts that rule them, and the streets that shape them. The Gnomes inevitably trickled towards the new, and those Elves that left the wild with them became City Elves or "Grey Elves". Whilst all fey are connected to the Wyld, the place that moulded them into who they are, that place of constant flux and cycle is often retold by the Grey Elves with a cautious tone, of the madness and whimsy that that place inspired, of the war for autonomy that they so thoroughly lost, of fiercely independent cousins burned and fled.

The Elves of the Glades, those that stuck to more primal ways, carry out their stewardship among treetop villages and secluded groves throughout their chosen gardens; the many primeval forests and wooded areas that remain across the shards. The Wood Elves are the scouts, hunters & gatherers, and rangers of these places, whilst the High Elves are the administrators, soldiers, weavers, and crafters, and in most Materiae, the two kinds work and live closely together.

The generations of Elves that have lived in the towns and cities have reflected that lifestyle so thoroughly their affinity for the woods has almost entirely dissipated, being replaced instead with an affinity for crowds, politics and urban sprawl. Wild Elves shudder at the thought, though the occasional traveller or orphan of their kind can be found in the cities too, oft walking the path of the Ranger, separating city and wild whilst truly belonging to neither. It’s gotten to the point that, Materiae over, folk refer more often to “Grey” and “Wild” elves rather than High, Wood or City.

High Elves and Wood Elves are available in the **Player Handbook**. Grey Elves may be of either, depending on their traditions (or even statistically and visibly Half-Elf), or taken from “City Elves” below:

#### **City Elves**; (Elf variant)

**Ability Score Increase** – your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Agile Scaler** – You gain a climb speed equal to 30ft.

**Mask of the Urbane** – You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by crowds, smoke, structures, and other urban features.

**Political Instinct** – you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice; Deception, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Dwarves

> “I had the honour to visit the Hall of Ancestors in the city of Braceholm once, during my time as a mercenary for the diplomatic mission from Var. Imagine, if you can, a hall so vast you can see none of the far walls, and columns perfectly square and perfectly regular stretching out forever, so they make your eyes go funny with repeating patterns. And standing in between them all, row after row of exquisitely carved, and exactingly unique, statues. Ancestors one and all, and lovingly maintained.”
>  – recounting from Var town-guard Filip.

Some at first believed dwarves to be a line of stunted humans, or perhaps particularly estranged members of the Little People. The truth was closely guarded, and lost with time. Most every race in the world descends from the First Men and the Little People, whether a natural extension of them or some sort of change after the induction of some blood or power. Some of the races were born of the enhancement and uplifting of lesser beasts, such as the Aarakocra or the Tortle, and some from the mixing of Man and Beast, such as the Harpy and Minotaur. But not the Dwarves.

Dwarves have always held that they were crafted from the roots of mountains, which would certainly describe the supernatural affinity for stone, and their predilection for remaining underground. They are so like Men and Little People, just stockier and of a height between them, but they’re utterly unable to form bloodlines. They, of all the races that shun the sun, have no weakness to it. They are an enigma, that not even the Dwarves hold a solution for.

The sad fact is that the truth of the Dwarves is long forgotten to nearly all, including them. The Cataclysm saw the end of their Old Way and with the shattering of the roots of the world, the dwarves lost nearly all their cities, countless numbers of their people, and much of their culture, as hall after hall came tumbling down. The stone-tuned dwarves had long since retreated from the roots of the mountains from which they fashioned their oldest keeps, if only as a matter of survival.

Most of the survivors surfaced under the Sun, though some went to the deepest layers of the world, if not deeper, and were forgotten. The Dwarven Families and Clans, terms loaded heavily to this day even if their origin is shrouded in mystery, spread to the surface and the new mountains of the Shattering.

After a thousand years of history and isolation all the Dwarves have of their original heritage had faded to barely retold myth, and the few remaining ancient halls they religiously protect, filled with tens of thousands of ancient and perfectly life-like stone statues of dwarven ancestors. Now, horizons are opening up once more, and the dwarves are encountering the rumours and myths of their lost history, sometimes face to face.

Dwarves can be found in the *Player’s Handbook*.

### The Cursed of Gruumsh

> “The outer walls have crumbled. The inner gate is breached. The green tide is here! Save us! Pl...”
> 
>  – graffiti scrawled onto an ancient Czarkasi ruin, translated into modern Imperial Common.

The orc God took some First Men, and in an attempt to spite and better the other Gods, blessed/cursed them, altering their colouration and making them tall, savage, strong and fast breeding, and as equally full of rage as he, even as it corrupted and wilted their minds. He charged his progeny to sally forth into the world and make life tremble and fear his name. The orcs, minds twisted, did so with gusto.

The ancient legends tell of great orc hordes, crusades of the Red if you will, sweeping from horizon to horizon, burning and pillaging, reaving and looting all in sight, all in honour of Gruumsh. Orcs spread and multiplied until they covered the world, the pride of Gruumsh, and kingdoms of Eden had to rally great armies to push them back. The Legions of Terror would have such an impact their legacy would echo well after the Shattering.

However, the curse is now old enough to be more myth than legend, and the days of the legions are millennia long gone. Today most orcs can throw the yolk of their anger off entirely, or at least keep it contained as the Red Rage. They join civilized society or form more stable societies of their own, apart from the raving orc hordes. These orcs call themselves the Tuskmen, and fight against the legacy of their ancestors. This is not so easily forgiven or forgotten. The ongoing damage and danger of their rabid brothers and sisters does little to help their reputation either.

There are variations on the normal orc. Gruumsh took also the ogre's and cursed them wholesale, where their original form is now a forgotten mystery. Like any race from the First Men, Orcs can also be subject to the bloodlines, and Fel orcs and Kai, those touched by devilry or fae respectively, work variations upon the theme. But they are all quite rare, and no-where near as widespread as their normal cousins, who are just as likely to slaughter corruption in the crib as they do in the field.

Tuskmen are available in the *Player’s Handbook* as “Half Orcs”. The monstrous race "Orc" is unavailable as the red rage of Gruumsh makes them unreasonable and therefore unsuitable for play. If one wants to play a literal half-orc (from the union of a human and an orc) they may, though statistically little changes. 

If one wants to play an orc with a bloodline, they may (with the DM’s permission) replace a number of the Half-Orc traits Menacing, Relentless Endurance, and/or Savage Attacks, with the traits of the other races. For example, with the Tiefling’s Hellish Resistance, or the Elf’s Fey Ancestry or Keen Senses.

### Exotic Races
There are many exotic races spread across the Materiae, most rare or near-none existent in Mitteland, though a few shards have sizeable populations that make them the norm rather than mere rumour. Such races include; 
- The various beast races whether they be of fur or scale, such as the Tabaxi or Lizardmen, or a hybrid of man and beast, such as the Harpies or Shifters.
- The dark elves that escape the evil cultures from down below, and others of pure heart but evil societal origins like Yuan-ti, Duergar and Dhampir.
- The Goliaths, first men who somehow inherited the blessing of the Giants, ancient beings of immense size and custodians of powers so ancient no record remains.
- Or one of many other rare and exotic peoples.

Two, the Goblinoids (reworked) and the Dragonborn (which can be found in the *Player Handbook*), are detailed below. As for others, please ask your DM for further information.

### The Dragon Curse

> “A dragonborn visited my village once, offering to trade what he had found out in the wilds. We shooed him away right quick though of course. Can’t be having their lot around. What if they poison the well? Or set fire to us?”
> 
>  – interview of a farmer, by Eric Timbermill in his best seller “The Peoples of the Imperial Realms”.

Dragons are beings of old magic, shapers by very nature. They blinked, and the fabric of reality around them warped to their whims. By breath, by wing, and by claw, they moulded the way of things into a shape they found more pleasing, and their avarice knew no bounds. That many of them found destruction pleasing had always been to the ire and despair of the other races. Some say that The Three Creators, their works done, their energies spent, their mind’s emptied, shattered in death, and that these broken empty vessels, still echoing with the Words of creation, became the dragons. It is said that their great greed is fuelled by this emptiness, this need to fill it, and the frustration that nothing seems to be satisfactory fuels their anger and hate.

At some point in history, the first dragon made the first dragonborn out of a man, shaping it into its own likeness. To what end is unknown and lost to time, but now various dragons over the ages, including After Shattering, have made their own dragonborn, out of jealous imitation or genuine desire, or perhaps on the whimsy of granting a mad man’s request. Those twisted by the dragon’s curse gain many physical benefits and magical powers, but many (especially of the first generation) revile their visage and the dragon madness; that hungering greed, the hollowing emptiness.

Depending on their colour, dragonborn always have their wills bent towards the natural (often destructive) inclinations of the wyrm that shaped them. Not only this, but the long-standing enmities between the flights were also inherited by their pawns, and a red dragonborn will feel in them a natural revulsion and compulsion to violence at the sight of a black, and they them, and so on.

Some dragonborn were made from whole groups of people in one fell swoop, others started their own tribes, and to this day these legacies continue on. Due to these circumstances, and the nature of the curse, this leaves many dragonborn in tribes based strictly on their colour, wary of outsiders, insular to a fault, and of relatively little political or territorial power.  

Some tribes disbanded long ago, fate and their natures working against them. They either died out entirely, or their distant descendants learned to mingle with the rest of humanity. Some were born alone of the union between a dragon, polymorphed in human form, and a human. Others became the nucleus around which a tribe formed, persevering up to the present. With their heritage always setting them apart, tying them eternally to creatures powerful and anathema to humanity, such individuals must struggle to make their way in life.

Dragonborn are technically a human bloodline, and can even mingle and produce offspring with their soft-skin cousins, but the magic that made them was primeval and strong, and the children of such unions are, the vast majority of the time, dragonborn themselves, fully inflicted with the dragon's curse. Such is the strength of that primeval magic, that dragonborn do not have mixed blood, and cannot hold onto other Touches. 

A few dragonborn were made during the Edict alongside the creation of the metallic dragons. Over the millennia since the Shattering, and the steady loss of chromatic dragonborn, one is just as likely to find, these days, a metallic dragonborn as a chromatic one, for both in the end are exceedingly rare.

Dragonborn can be found in the *Player’s Handbook*.

### Goblinkin
> “My story? Why do you want to know? … I see. I was born some years ago and grew up raving in the crags to the north. When I outsmarted all the rabble in my pack, I became Nilbog. Then, realising what a collection of morons those Goblins were, I moved to the city. Training for the guard I became Hobgoblin. I’ve since tossed a few clutches of rabble back into the crags myself. That’s my story.”
> 
>  – from a conversation with a Hobgoblin gate guard in the Mid-South, by Eric Timbermill.

Goblins are small, squat creatures whose heads are almost too large for their bodies. They have tan skin that has orange highlights and a mouth filled with too many sharp teeth, often riddle with forgotten bits of rotting meat. They use their claw-like nails or crude clubs to attack their foes, and dress in filthy rags (if anything at all). They have a mop of greasy hair whose hairline is too high, and tufts of mud-caked fur on their feet and knees.

Goblins struggle in their manic compulsions, typically towards acquiring shiny things and being vicious, and are the perennial boogie-man of the countryside. And yet they can, in time, transform from their pitiful selves into bugbears (powerful ones) or Nilbogs (smart ones), and from there into upright and prideful Hobgoblins. These are the Goblinoids, creatures born of the principle of Struggle, Survival and Competition to the point where their very bodies are product of struggle for betterment, improvement, and superiority, starting from arguably one of the most pitiful self-knowing creatures, into one of the most powerful.

Maglubiyet is their God, the God of Struggle and Conquest. He is the one that is said to have taken the first Goblin to show ambition, Gnirsk, and his rabble of weak and foul creatures, and granted them His blessing. The blessing of Kalgradyet, Metamorphosis. With this, Goblin spawn could discipline their minds and metamorphosise into Nilbogs, cunning and swift creatures, able to turn anything around. Spawn who disciplined their bodies could metamorphosise into Bugbears, long of limb and sneaky, able to ambush and haul in even the juiciest of prey. Nilbogs and Bugbears that could then attain the other’s discipline could make the final metamorphosis into true Hobgoblins, the master and final state of Goblinkin, and rulers of the holdfasts. The Saga of Gnirsk the first Hobgoblin and his many legions and conquests in the name of Maglubiyet are shared around Goblinkin campfires to this day.

Like Goblins, Hobgoblins are tan of skin, leaning more to red than orange, and are long of pointed ear. There, however, the similarities end. A hobgoblin stands tall and proud, as tall as any human, with a broad frame covered in lean muscle, which is utterly hairless. Blue-yellow-red eyes glisten with their keen tactical intelligence, and the chaos of the Goblin has been fully tamed into the discipline required of metamorphosis.

Hobgoblins, to the few circles that care, are notoriously difficult to gender. They stand of equal height, bald, and of roughly equal frame. Males tend to have more blue or red tinted noses, and females slightly wider hips. Males tend to metamorphosise into bugbears first, and females into nilbogs, giving the former slightly longer arms and the latter slenderer fingers and sparkling eyes, but the tendency is a weak one. 

Females bare litters of Goblins, often six to ten at a time, and they give them over to the battalion crèches (or toss the rabid ankle-biters straight into the wild, in many cases). Newborns immediately scramble and bite and fight within days of their eyes opening, and as such parenthood is an unknown phenomenon to Goblinkin, both culturally and biologically. Any stage of Goblinoid is known to breed (often to the despair of neighbouring races), and only because infant goblins are just as manic and violent as they are, do they survive at all.

Players who wish to play Goblinoids need to make a number of decisions. Can their character undergo the discipline and training required to undergo transformation? Do they even want to? Such transformations are known to transform not only the body, but even the mind of the goblin in question. When undergoing a transformation ensure your character meets the prerequisites, and consult ahead of time with your DM so you can plan an appropriate event that forms the foundational moment and what changes in character might occur. When your character undergoes metamorphosis, you may wish to pick new or additional personality traits.

The Goblin races (Goblin, Bugbear, Hobgoblin) available in the books are replaced with the following race;

#### Goblinoid (Player Race)
Tan-skinned creatures, starting an almost lurid orange at birth as small vicious goblins, mature and metamorphosise, or not, into the lean disciplined machines known as Hobgoblins. The Goblinoids are not as many believe, a family of creatures, but instead a single species of creature with multiple life stages. 

Your Goblinoid character has the following racial traits;

**Ability Score Increase** – your Dexterity score increases by 1 and your Constitution increases by 1.

**Age** – goblinoids are born as Goblins and mature incredibly quickly, reaching adulthood at 3 years. If they fail to undergo metamorphosis they do not tend to live long, and finding a goblin older than 35 is rare. Hobgoblin lifetimes, if not cut short by war, can stretch to a century.

**Alignment** – Goblins are manic and unable to resist the impulses and drives at their core, and tend to be incredibly self-centred and petty. They are chaotic evil. Those that can overcome their impulses or channel their energies tend to undergo metamorphosis, becoming neutral or lawful as they do. Those few goblinoids who also temper their ego may also shift alignments from evil to neutral or even good, especially as disciplined hobgoblins looking out for the interests of the battalion over their own, showing compassion to the injured, so that they may fight again.

**Speed** – your base walking speed is 30ft.

**Darkvision** – You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Languages** – you can speak, read and (perhaps) write Common and Goblin.

**Subrace** – the blessing of Kalgradyet allows Goblinoids to transform, taking on stronger and stronger forms. All Goblinoids start as the Goblin Subrace. Then, when they have met the prerequisites, they can transform into a different subrace. Transformation means you lose all traits of one subrace and gain all traits of the other, which include adjusting ability scores and skills.

#### Goblin
**Ability Score Increase** – your Dexterity score increases by 1.

**Size** – your size is Small

**Nimble Escape** – You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns. 

**Fury of the Small** – When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Nilbog

**Prerequisites** – Intelligence 13, 3rd Character Level

**Ability Score Increase** – your Intelligence score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Small

**Reversal of Mania** – your days of being subject to your own urges are gone, and you have achieved a discipline of mind that most creatures of the material world find astounding, especially in contrast to normal Goblins. You have advantage on any saving throw caused by a spell from the enchantment school of magic. You also have advantage on any further saving throws made to end an ongoing enchantment spell’s effect.

**Tinker’s Fingers** – your small and nimble fingers, much longer and slenderer than the stubby claws of a Goblin, are perfect for manipulating fine contraptions and undergoing delicate works. You gain proficiency with Artisan’s Tools, if you did not already, and if you did you add twice your proficiency bonus when using them. In addition, you may use your Artisan’s Tools to make repairs or Intelligence (Investigation) checks on non-magical clockwork devices or constructs with advantage.

#### Bugbear

**Prerequisites** – Strength 13, 3rd Character Level

**Ability Score Increase** – your Strength score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Medium

**Sneaky** – you are proficient in the Stealth skill. If you were already, you add twice your proficiency bonus to Stealth checks.

**Long-Limbed** – when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

**Powerful Build** – you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

**Hooked Claws** – your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, if the creature was surprised by the Hooked Claws unarmed strike (due to a surprise round, or being hidden, etc), you can make a free grapple check against the creature.

#### Hobgoblin

**Prerequisites** – Strength 13, Intelligence 13, 5th Character Level, either of the Nilbog or Bugbear subrace

**Ability Score Increase** – your Strength score increases by 1 and your Intelligence score increases by 1

**Size** – your size is Medium

**Nilbog Legacy** – you have advantage on any spell saving throw caused by a spell from the enchantment school of magic. You also have advantage on any further saving throws made to end an ongoing enchantment spell’s effect. You are proficient in Artisan’s Tools.

**Bugbear Legacy** – you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. You are proficient in the Stealth skill.

**Martial Training** – after undergoing your transformations and at last being admitted into a holdfast (or from some other tutor or training), you have been trained and readied for war. You are proficient in the next tier of armour (light if you weren’t proficient in any, medium if you were proficient in light, heavy if you were proficient in medium), and you are proficient in using Shields and Simple Weapons. In addition, you are proficient in two martial weapons of your choice.
