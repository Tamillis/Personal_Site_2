# Calendars and Timekeeping <br/> <small>In the Materiae</small>

Timekeeping is a crucial component of civilization, but the all encompassing chaos of the shattering rendered all old ways null and void. The knowledge of how those in Edenic times kept their calendars too was mostly lost, and for the privileged few who can notice, not even the flow of the seasons was unaffected. They coined the term 'seasonal topology' and used the seasons and astral positions of Shards to put together a map, and charted the various seasons of the Shards to find that in these times, season stilled seemed to 'flow', just with a lot more 'turbulence'.

The quality of the seasons was no longer a regular thing, so even the meaning of the word “season” itself began to differ. Some folks measure time by harvests of particular staple crops, as their week-to-week weather changes little, and some by a chosen number of day-night cycles. Thousands of shards across the material universe each measure time in their own way. Thus, the societies of the world have ended up with a variety of different time keeping methods. 

Many keep to a calendar of 7 day weeks, 4 and/or 5 week months, and 12 month years, a hangover from ancient Edenic times, though the exact definition and use of these varies across the disparate shards, should indeed they use this sort of calendar at all. 

Since creation the Materiae have had partially chaotic cycles of the sun, as it waxes and wanes in power, on Eden bringing about the variations in day to day weather as you and I are familiar with them. 

Around this the warmth and cool of the seasons regularly came and went, wrapping around the Edenic world in a predictable cycle, with intermediate zones where the colours of the seasons simplified to 'wet' and 'dry'. Those being the cold season of winter and the warm season of summer, and the growing season of spring and the harvesting season of autumn, or the wet season of monsoon and dry season of arakis. At least on much of Eden. Some places record histories of pure Fire or pure Ice.

The shards have lost this regularity, seasons coming and going at varying rates, and on occasion out of order.

The one regularity of the Shards and Eden itself is the process of equal night and day, which seems to be a common phenomenon to all the shards, though curiously each Shard's length of a day-night cycle seems to vary considerably between them (to the point where some are so long as to be perpetual day or night).

### The Imperial week of Mitteland

The Imperial Calendar of Mitteland is used throughout the Empire and even beyond its borders where it has, or had had, significant influence. It is maintained by the bureau of standards and measures, and is named for the six cosmic axes plus one. It is as follows:
- **Angelsday** - "Ey-n-z-di" – or Holyday, named after Good.
- **Judgesday** - "Juj-di" – named after Reason
- **Serversday** - "Servs-di" – named after Logic
- **Silensday** – "signs-di" - the old name is Devilsday, which after the Cataclysm fell understandably out of favour, named after Evil
- **Passionsday** – named after Passion
- **Feyday** – another name is Freeday, named after Chaos 
- **Marketday** – sometimes known as Emperor’s Day to the particularly patriotic. Older names are Mansday, Firstday or Restday. 

The Imperial Calendar counts 4 weeks per month, counting months by counting the number of times it’s been per named day. 

They then count the months of a season, with announcements from heliography scholars and arcano-seasonographers in the capital announcing season changes, with the next month being the start of the new season, typically giving seasons 2 to 5 months, though usually 3 or 4.

However, if this event falls on the 4th week of a month an extra week is added to give chance for the message to spread, giving a 5th Angelsday of the 3rd Month of Summer (for example). Even then the message might arrive too slow leaving some notetakers to relabel records, or mark weeks as Passedover Angelsday (for example), counting the next week from the 2nd or so on. 

A year is counted from the start of Spring. Due to this irregularity most cultures including the Empire of Mitteland waive a precise birthday in favour of celebrating communal New Years days with everyone gaining 1 year in age. Other cultures have a calendar of named days they independently cycle through, celebrating age based on that instead. Others mark birthdays by season. Some track birthdays specifically by overflowing into the next season. For example, being born on 1st Judges 4th Spring might have to celebrate their birthday on the 1st Judgesday of the 1st Month of Summer, if there isn’t 4 months of Spring.

Years themselves are simply counted from the accepted year 1 After Cataclysm, which coincides with the founding of Elonia, itself more of a retroactively applied particular day (the survivor polity of the time having rather more important things to do than hold a ‘founding’ event).

An example date may then be; “the 3rd Silensday of the 2nd Month of Winter, Year 1801 After Cataclysm.” Which is written in short as “3rd Silens o.t. 2nd of Winter 1801 A.C.” or “3rd Silens 2nd Winter 1801”, or even "3Si 2W 1801" in compact records or even using the unique symbols associated with each day and season.
