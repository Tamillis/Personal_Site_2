# Ihleiska Map

This is a map of the Many Kingdoms of Ihleiska, a hitherto backwater of Mitteland until recently where Imperial interests have waxed strongly with Stannis' New Army's ties to orc stock. Now a conflict of three ideologies rears as times are changing in the arboreal vallies of Ihleiska. Native beliefs vie with the Everlight faith while fiercely independent 'Kings' seek to retain their independence against Imperial influence, evenwhile ancient residents vie amongst each other to dominate in this place filled to the brim with the old and forgotten, and now the very new.
