# The Firmaments

## The Inner Firmament
Closest to the heart of the Universe, easiest to traverse too, and most “complete” and permanent of the outer planes, only subject to the whims of the most powerful, are the planes of the Inner Firmament. They are also considered the “weakest” of the absolutes, and many souls, minor sinners and other unremarkable folk pass through here, where they can further reflect and gain the truth they failed to in the physical realms. 

### Arcadia
Good Reasoned Logic

The peaceable agrarian idyll, kingdoms of ideal feudalism of divinely appointed philosopher-aristocrats. Thriving orchards of perfectly lined trees, checkerboard vegetable patches, ruler-straight irrigation, orderly fields, perfect smooth roads and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes, make up Arcadia. The mountains are unblemished by erosion and the valleys aesthetically balanced with evenly meandering rivers. It is the model of the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal; food, drink and sleep optional, and time is cyclic, with choirs of beneficial organisations being sacred, and nothing harmful is allowed to intrude on the harmony of this snapshot of a reality. Quiet and peaceful folk, and those that need quiet and peace, pass time here, spending the measure of their days until they reach their fill of peace and can move on to other planes or beyond. The universe’s mental hospital.

- Saint Dramial – the patron of cultivation

**Cycles of Arcadia** – nothing is allowed to permanently harm, and solace is found in repetition. Each day starts the same per week, and positive actions that are repeated from previous days gain a cumulative +1 bonus up to a maximum of +5. If the streak is broken the bonus is reset. Conversely negative actions gain a cumulative malus.
**Peace and Quiet** – any levels of stress, exhaustion or insanity are recovered automatically by one level each day.

### Gehenna
Passionate Logical Evil

The plane of suspicion and greed. The law of the Yuggoloths, Githyanki and other pirates of the planes and their Creed rules, whilst each is absolutely individualistic and seeks to further their own passions, often at the cost of others. They only work together at Moots of the Gehenna Council and to punish others that break the Creed.

The plane is embellished with the channelled and stolen threads of the elements, woven to fulfil the Creed but allow each as much freedom as they can tolerate. Petty larceny, and other such felonies, bring souls here, to test their moral metal and see if they should ascend or descend onward to other planes, or find the full measure of their worth here and eventually pass on. The plane of materialism, that souls go to to overcome materialism, or perfect it.

**Davy Jones** – one of the greater Yuggoloths, known to take on the form of a heavily bearded/betentacled human sailor, is one of the most powerful entities on the plane, and known to grant power to his followers and enforcers even in the mortal world.

**Part of the plane, part of the Creed** – whenever a character breaks the Creed, as written in the Book of Gehenna at the Moot, they are marked with a red hand until the next score-and-one of sunrises. Any attack against a marked creature is made at Advantage and incurs no Sin.

I)	The Captain is to have two full Shares; the Quartermaster is to have one Share and one Half; The Doctor, Mate, Gunner and Boatswain, one Share and one Quarter. All other men receive one share. Any who take more than their share, or who unrightfully deny a fellow his, shall be Marked.

II)	He that shall be found guilty of unlawfully Striking or Abusing in any regard fellow crew or those under Parley, shall be Marked. Parley is declared between two captains upon their meeting and applies to both crew for as long as either remains on the other’s vessel in whole or in part. Every man's quarrels within a crew or Parley to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol.

III)	He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice in the time of engagements, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit. He who flees punishment shall be Marked.

IV)	If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit. He who flees punishment shall be Marked.

V)	If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, etc. be found on Board of any Prize or Prizes to the value of a Piece of Eight, & the finder do not deliver it to the Quarter Master in the space of 24 hours he shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.

VI)	He that is found Guilty of Defrauding one another to the value of a Royal of Plate, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit. He who flees punishment shall be Marked.

VII)	He that shall have the Misfortune to lose a Limb in time of Engagement, shall have the Sum of Six hundred pieces of Eight, and remain aboard as long as he shall think fit. If refused payment, his captain and his crew shall all be them Marked.

VIII)	Good Quarters to be given when Craved. If denied, shall the executor be Marked.

IX)	He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her. If refused by his Captain, Quartermaster or Mate, or whomever is responsible, shall be Marked.

X)	He that shall be guilty of Drunkenness in time of Engagement shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit. He who flees punishment shall be Marked.

XI)	No snapping of Guns or ignition of Magic in the Hold. He who does shall be Marked.

XII)	If at any time the Captain takes upon a guest, they shall be treated as under Parley for the duration of their voyage. If at any time a Man offers to meddle with them, without their Consent, shall be Marked.

XIII)	No sorcerer or possessor of powers arcane or divine shall be denied their last ounce of Power. He that demands the use of such shall be Marked.

In all cases, he who is marked may be voluntarily Marooned with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot, and no other equipment or component other than the clothes on his back. This removes the Mark.

It is often the case that the Marooned are pressganged into the next vessel that passes, or suffer a long and draining existence of isolation and material denial until they pass on.

### Ysgard
Chaotic Passionate Good

Small time and wannabe heroes come to Ysgard and its capital of Valorhall to test their mettle not only against each other but the plane itself, its wilderness, giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that thunder across Ysgard's vast wild terrains and harsh seasons, deep oceans and deeper caverns. Those who wish for or accept their call to action but stumble early or fail on that path come here, to find their measure and their reward, and learn to face their challenges seen ahead. They find solace in the completion of their quest or learn that the path of the hero is not theirs, and go beyond.

**Hero’s Journey** – all who enter Ysgard gain a Hero point. At each stage of the journey (call, threshold, trials, abyss, revelation, atonement, return) characters gain another Hero Point: that they may better find there worth. 

### The Rainbow River
A multicoloured river of light connects the three inner firmaments, allowing souls whose belonging has changed to go to the plane that fits them better, or ferry those whose passing brings them between. One particular note is the constant flow of food from Arcadia to Ysgard (and even Gehenna, through piracy of course), and the injured to Arcadia: sinners of both washing up in Gehenna.

## The Central Firmament
The nine central firmaments are, in brief:

**GR** – **Philosophia** is the heaven of the philosopher and pondering the depths and meanings of will and want. The satisfaction of a good reason, and an impossible answer, can be found in the halls and corridors of this heavenly academy. Students, planar beings and souls of the academia, research within strict guides or frenetic whim, for the betterment of knowledge and the benefit of all. Here resides The Headmaster, God of Knowledge, the White Wizard, Gendledare.
Memory Palace – any knowledge checks are made at advantage. 

**GC** – **Arborea** is a place of wild moods, of spontaneous and unpredictable good-will and feelings of happiness, of contrary passions and whimsical goals. Its good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, but their recklessness can have unforeseen consequences. There the mountains and forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits that brook no infringement. Travellers must tread lightly in this primal heaven.
Wanton Good – creatures are struck by impulses of kindness, at the DM’s discretion. Use an anti-madness table. 

**GP** – **Animaria**, “The Beastlands”, natural good, the absence of human reason, the balance of individual chaos in natural law. The plane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also speaks to the animal within all living things. 
Beastform – Any visiting humanoids and souls take on animal forms, that which best fits their soul. Unless a character has undergone a significant transformation of self, their animal form is fixed.

**PC** – **Pandemonium**, instant and random indulgence, maddening wild urges. Many consider it an evil place due to the harms that result, but they’re never intended and oft fleeting, with desires for good just as common as ones for evil. The winds scream with passions unrealised, randomly driving those that listen to indulge in them and lessen their strength. The sun chaotically wavers between open and closed semi randomly (ignoring extremes).
Impulse Control – at random moments (not every hour etc), have all characters make wisdom saves vs a DC of 5/10/15/20 depending on if they passed the previous save cumulative, resets to 5 when failed. Roll on a table of random urges, get players to play out how they fulfil that urge as fast as possible.

**PE** – **The Abyss**, indulgent evil, sudden torment. It embodies all that is harmful, gruesome, and sadistic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms of inventive torture at the hands of evil sprites and mad devils, often on each other, but most delectably to the souls they harvest. Few souls need long to find absolution of pain here.
Imp of the Perverse – at random moments (not every hour etc.), have all characters make wisdom saves vs a DC of 5/10/15/20, resetting to 5 once they fail once, increasing by difficulty withe each success, to not succumb to the imp of the perverse. In that moment ask each player who failed what their character would do in that moment to cause harm for the sole purpose of causing harm in that moment.

**PL** – **Acheron**, the eternal battlefield, where passions are guided by law, that passions may be impressed on others, be that in Love or War. It is the plane of strife, and the nature of the place enables strife to continue unabated, giving strength to those that succeed, and throwing those that are defeated back in the ring.
Engine of Strife – passions must be lawfully followed, a structured approach to fulfilling your wants. Nobody has precisely the same wants, so imposing them on others naturally begets conflict. Those on top attempting to enforce their values, those below trying to rebel to enforce theirs; or the self-same conflict between two disparate groups. This all builds up a Strife Modifier. Every time you succeed in making a roll for what you want, reduce your Strife by one to a minimum of 0. Every time you fail, increase it by one. Add your Strife modifier to any roll you make that follows your character’s passions. Anytime a superior you are voluntarily subordinate to orders you to do something against your passions, and you don’t rebel then and there, your Strife goes up by 1.

**LE** – **Carceri**, mechanical prison hell, where souls are stripped of all freedoms, its jailers' strict servitors without compassion, and punishments harsh. The model for all other prisons in existence, a plane of abeyance and incarceration. Made from innumerable (literal) layers of security, it is the miserable home for the traitors and backstabbers of the world whose souls serve time, and many sinful souls serve time to find enlightenment. Those who wander here find they are quickly trapped on this prison plane, for the jailers have heard every excuse and if you are here, then you will be imprisoned. Any time your sould need serve to become light enough to be free, you will serve. 
No Man Is Free – if you are here you will be incarcerated. When bound, and you will be bound, you have disadvantage on checks to escape. This includes being grappled, caught in a trap or undoing the functions of a cage. 

**LR** – **Bytopia**, the plane of perfect precise balance; all things come in twos and halves. Bytopia is the ideal of productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done, for good or evil, and balance in all things. Those that worked hard to provide balance are provided for in death, and those that need to learn it are here punished, fairly, as passions and whimsy that upset the cart are excised. Yet, no good deed goes unpunished, and those that pass through learn the limits of balance. 
Balance in all things – all skill checks, saving throws and attack rolls take 10 instead of rolling a d20, and damage rolls take the average value of all dice, rounded down. Once per short rest you can opt to roll a dice. 

**LG** – **Celestia** – The model of justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, where angels and champions of good rally against incursions of evil in the universe, Celestia is the closest mortal Heaven. Many of the old Gods worshipped by peasants and city folk alike, hail from this plane, as they seek the boons of Logical Good. Those who sacrificed to see justice and order come to the world are rewarded for their service, and those who need learn its lessons are recruited into the Celestial Crusades to combat the incursions of evil elsewhere in the heavens.
Inherent Righteousness – the plane of systematic good guides your hand to good deeds, turning it from evil ones, so that a soul can learn the difference. Any ‘good’ action gains double your proficiency modifier, any ‘bad’ action instead has a minus proficiency modifier, if you are proficient in the skill/tool/weapon at hand.

### The Three Roads 
The black & white Road of Morals paved in obsidian & alabaster intentions, the red & blue Road of Desire paved in words of vice and justification, the grey & prismatic Road of Choice paved in rotating cog flagstones sliding on slick shimmering oil that lights on fire or freezes solid at random. 

These are the dual-lane Roads. The Roads themselves are bare-bones sorts of demi-planes that bridge the Central Firmament planes to like-minded planes, though creatures often attempt to skip across the central reservation, and invade their mirror planes, but over the aeons creatures have made their homes here too, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering, passage. The general “shape” of each Road forms three axes, with the one of Good and Evil, one of Passion and Reason, and one of Logic and Chaos. Each road is the same length as any other, making the “edge” roads of the square bend slightly to match the length of the diagonal and the top-bottom road, giving all roads a meeting area in the middle, and where most of the conflict occurs and living denizens exist, where all the roads get mighty close. Each of the Central Firmaments then has two connections, a matching one for each of their constituent planar alignments. 

## The Outer Firmament
The Outer Firmaments, being the furthest from the physical realm, can be said to be the most “extreme”, and only those souls with extreme needs, desires and karmas or at the extreme ends of their journey, end up here. It is from here that the true powers of the Fundamentals come, able to shape the universe due to their sheer brute natures, and the most powerful and removed-from-mortals Gods reside.

**Good** – **Elysium**, home of the angels of virtue and the embodiment of the ideal of positive actualisation. It is the heaven of rapture, a place where tears of joy glisten on many a cheek, and the bright and revealing light and life of an endless enrapturing day, any who earn it bask in overwhelming rapturous reward, until their self is more whole than it ever was, and they move on. The Master of Elysium is Aleph, the first angel.

**Reason** – **Forum**, home of the jurors, those that judge the long-term collective benefit. Embodiment of the rational virtues, Forum is the pedestal of results for all. The many forums of Forum allow all minds, great and small, come together to discuss all angle of a situation or problem, and can find the very best solution that balances all peoples, all goals, all desires, and that can stretch them out through all time.  A magical connection links the Palace of Mirrors with the Judges of Forum, that every soul can be weighed.

**Logic** – **Mechanicus**, home to servitors, embodies absolute law, the execution of a goal through meticulous systems, the virtues of the well-oiled machine, and the system without flaw. It is likened to the scales of justice. The creators of contracts, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all interlocked and turning according to their measure.

**Evil** – **The Hells**. It is the ultimate plane of Evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells obey the laws of their superiors and rebel to follow their passions. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, to advance themselves, though their collective will is the harm and retardation of all life. If anything, the fouler the better. At the very top of the hierarchy is Asmodeus, the Prince of Punishment. Deep within is Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, Treachery and Might. The war in the hells is the divide between those that seek The End, which they see as the ultimate evil, and those that seek to perpetuate evil forever.

**Passion** – **Hedonia**, home of the demons of vice and self-indulgence. Demons of wrath, lust, greed, gluttony, sloth, pride, vanity, envy, charity, and any other of the multitude of passions and impulses that can rise up in a thinking creature, who seek to indulge in their natures as much and as frequently as possible, and abhor abstinence and patience, and care not for the willingness of others. The nature of this place stokes the passions of all, and provides them with the means to fulfil them. Only those pure beings without vice, or have utterly tempered their minds, pass through Hedonia without indulgence.

**Chaos** – **The Warp**, home of the sprites. Values are foolish, wants are passing, reasons are for the weak, and above all else, rules are to be broken utterly and constantly. Sprites are less beings of thought, than collections of random and bizarre impulses coupled with the abilities to follow them. The Warp is as close to the Primordial Chaos as one can get within the Universe, the echo of that madness, just real enough to have real effects. It is also the most anathema to the Universe and its Cycle of Thoughts. Those of the exanima go here, as their “reward”, often losing any sense of personhood.
