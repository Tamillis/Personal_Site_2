# The Elemental Braid
Surrounding the material worlds, forming a border between them and the innermost Firmaments, is the elemental braid.

The least hospitable locations of the Braid are the places that only the elementals can call home; the pure strands of Fire, Earth, Air and Water. Such raw primordial energies render life there impossible. Life, true life, needs at least air and water to function, though most life cannot survive without the other elements too. 

The mythological locations whispered by mortals, such as the City of the Deeps and the Brass City, could only come to be in places where the elements were allowed to mix and the influences of civilization could survive. Those pure threads that border and overlap with each other create the Elemental Realms, though the original four are simply known as the Pure Realms, home only to elementals and those deceased souls closely entwined with the elements where there is where they can find nirvana.

### The Pure Realms
The source of Elemental Beings;
- **Heat** – scholars, don’t use fire any more. The nature of primordial Fire is more like raw heat or energy. Primal state of Energy.
- **Earth** – Primal state of Solid.
- **Water** – Primal state of Liquid.
- **Air** – Primal state of Gas.

### The Six Border Realms
The mixing of the four elements one on one, i.e. the “border”, produce these six realms;
- **Magma** – home to the Salamander and the Iron Fleet. Nothing natural lives here, though the vaporisation of the rock provides a thin toxic atmosphere, that and the heat make it inimical to non-elemental creatures. Fire and Earth.
- **Deeps** – home to the Kraken and the City of the Deeps, deep sea creatures live here, and is the second most abundant of the border realms, if still incredibly hostile due to the crushing weight and the cold lack of energy. Water and Earth.
- **Wave** – a cold dark endless hostile sea of whipping winds. Home of the sea serpent Litaanu the Leviathan, icebergs and cold-water adapted creatures. The most abundant border realm and the only one where only decent protection (cold weather gear and a boat) are needed to not instantly perish. Water and Air.
- **Flame** – home to the Great Phoenix and the flying firestorms of the Efreeti. The dry heat and lack of ground and cover make it a dangerous place for mortals, though the only one where they could theoretically survive as they are without protections or preparation. Until an Efreeti comes along, or they fall out of that section of the braid. Air and Fire.
- **Land** – home to the Tarasque and the Still Desert, no heat or water makes this an almost utterly lifeless place, and anything that does wander here is swiftly consumed by the Tarasque. Land and Air.
- **Steam** – home to the Bukharog [steam demon, the spirits of steam engines], the realm of scolding tumult and inhospitable to all but extremophile life. Fire and Water.

### The Incomplete Realms
Three mix to form the Incomplete Realms of:
- **Eternal Winter** (no Fire) – home of the winter wolf and giant caribou, and the Polar Ursine iceberg city of Svalbard, all surviving on an earth and ice consuming moss, krill and slow growing pines.
- **Open Ocean, Sea & Sky** (no Earth) – home to the Kuatoa, Sahuagin and Triton, as well as the World Turtle, progenitor of the giant turtles ridden by the Tortles. Water world. The lack of earth for islands or reefs makes life entirely reliant on the plankton chain.
- **The Wastes**, “Desert, Badlands and Scree” (no Water) – home to the giant worms and the City of Brass, the hot desert realms.
- **Primordial Marsh**, “Anaerobic Steaming Bog” (no Air) – all the chemical components of life starved of all air, home to the oozes and acids and bases of the world but otherwise extremely aberrant to nearly all life. Not only would it asphyxiate, it would then be scarred by chemical burns. Home to the King of Slimes.

### Temporary Realms
Quite occasionally all four mix to create Temporary Realms, ruled by the Embodied Elementals, wild dragons and planar travellers. The largest and only “permanent” one is the Fief of the Primordial One, which naturally draws and extrudes the essences of all the elements, thereby ensuring he is surrounded by ‘temporary’ land, though it often changes with the tumultuous Flow of Essences.

These lands, however, being mixes of all the elements (though of course the proportions vary, much like they do in the various shards of the material world), are exactly like the normal Materiae, and equally capable of supporting life. Life harassed by the various weaker elements that drift to these mixed, and therefore “muted” as they say, worlds, but life none the less. On occasion powerful wizards, fleeing factions or stranded crews end up settling these realms. Only the most powerful can coral the forces of the elements to ensure their Temporary Realm has permanency.

This is the origin of the Shard of Three Isles, though that is an ancient knowledge known to few.
