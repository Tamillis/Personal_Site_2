# Beliefs of the Materiae

## Beliefs of the Materiae
As with all cultures across time, an innumerable collection of ideas and understandings abound. However, some common threads can be found enough to the point where perhaps there's more to them than just folklore, superstition and local culture. The theories and thoughts of the materiae include the following.

## Physical Theory
The fundamental forces of this universe cleave across two paradigms. The first is the understanding that there are four states of matter, which correspond to the four classical elements told of in Creation, and that magical practitioners call on to this day; Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. 

Modern scholars prefer to describe these categories as Solid, Liquid, Gas and Energy respectively, to get away from the confusion between elemental Earth and dirt, Fire and heat or lack thereof, and so on.

The other paradigm is the Realite Fondamentale, the fundamental different formations of matter as created by the Prime and discovered by man, each of which has a unique blend of properties such as; charge, magnetism, acidity, momentum, potential, mana, organic profile and so on. In descending order of frequency these properties carry weight across the four states of matter, with "Energy" being the least differentiated, and "Solids" being the most.

However not all in the universe is made of matter. In fact, matter only mostly matters, pun intended, within the core of the universe. The closer to the edge one wanders the further “energy” begins to only matter. The physical energies, core to the function of matter, mean less and the importance of mystical energies takes over. Typically, these are classed also in two; positive energy and negative energy, two sides to the same coin. However, on a technical basis the raw force of arcane, confusingly labelled “Force”, is also a mystical force, making a trifecta. And as many know, 3 is the number of creation.

The physical laws of this universe bring about all the effects seen, and when it comes to damage they are often organised in the following manner;

### Physical
- **Bludgeoning** - the damage of blunt force trauma
- **Piercing** - the damage of deep-tissue wounds and damage to internal vitals
- **Slashing** - the damage of long lacerations prone to heavy bleeding
- **Thunder** - the damage of intense sound. In the age of explosives, thunderous damage has been so great as to rip a man's body apart.

### Organic
- **Acid** & Base - though fundemantal opposites in terms of the realite fondamentale, they're often categorised together as one class of bodily damage, due to the similar effects on the body.
- **Poison** & Disease - the damage of hostile substances inside the body. Often, through simple ignorance, disease is mistaken for poison
- **Psychic** - the damage of molecular disintegration when psychic forces insist that molecules are what they are not

### Energy
- **Fire** - the damage of heat cooking the body, turning matter into its "reduced" form
- **Cold** - though fundamentally the same as phenomena as fire, simply its extreme absence causing matter to change form, the physical effects were seen as different and a different label was made during simpler, less sophisticated times.
- **Lightning** - electricity, as scholars call it, produces very similar damage to fire if only internally, though its distinct visuals and physical phenomenal cause causes this differentiated label

### Mystical
- **Necrotic** - a.k.a. “Negative Energy”, the classical evil force of anti-life, infamous for its use to animate the undead and cause living flesh to die and rot even on a living frame
- **Radiant** - “Positive Energy”, the classical good force and often called "life force". Well known as the medium through which healing takes place, where a body's ability to heal is suplemented and rapidy sped up.
- **Force** - “Magical Force”, the sorcerer's instrument. The damage of matter undone. It is often mistaken with psychic damage, and though fundementally they are different forces, the bodily damage can look very similar. Psychic pressures temporarily mask one kind of thing into another. Force simply changes or erases it. A common source of such damage is Free Magic leakage.

### Number Theory
There are symbols and numbers that occur often enough in the cosmology of the universe that patterns where there ought be none come to be, and sometimes none where they ought be. Some have taken these to be divine works, and from them derived the numerology of the Existentiae.

1. **Unity** - the beginning whilst also meaning completeness. The sum of all things. Whole.
2. **Double** - evenness, positivity and the symbol of increase. It is also the number of connections, and so most take it to represent relationships.
3. **Trinity**, the **Holy** number - the number of the Godforms, the first real thing and the number of reality. Three Creators made the Three Physical Realms, and with a third point a line becomes a shape, something solid and with coverage. Three is always respected as a number of power.
4. the **Square** - the orderly number. The double of Double, it is seen as steadiness and accuracy. Alongside the circle, which 4 often also represents, the square is seen as a symbol of perfection and of magic, for squares and circles seem to be foundational to magical topography and spell-work.
5. **Man's Number** - as there are five fingers to the hand and five appendages to the man (arms, legs, and head), so is 5 said to be the number of man. As half of 10, the next power of unity, it is seen in a favourable light, but also as something incomplete. Incompleteness, then, is also seen as as symbol of man, and the natural state.
6. **Order** - through it, one reaches uncompromising fairness, but also divine cooperation, due to how it can be divided by so many numbers of import. Also it is the symbol of the outer cosmos, for 6 are the absolutes that divide the world (Good, Evil, Reason, Passion, Logic and Chaos). 
7. **Chaos** - the number that fits in nothing, relates to nothing, and thus causes strife. It is seen as unlucky or portentious of divided times to come. Conversely some cultures have taken it to be a symbol of indivision, of solidarity.
8. **Luck** - the only number of the first 10 not to be a power number, therefore taken by many as their lucky number, or the number of the lost and waiting to be found. Some also see it as a holy number or a number for the relationship to the Gods, because it is the 3rd (of God) double (relationship). Yet others believe it to be the number of the lost, the forgotten, or the shunned.
9. **Good** - three three's, it is the trinity of trinity, the work of Gods. Nine great stars mark the threshold of Elysium, and 9 holds great import to the religious of the Gods of Good, a fact observable across all the shards of the Materiae.
10. **Base** - the first magnitude of unitary, it is also seen as the idea of the whole, and the all-encompassing; the foundation. It is seen as structure, as it is the base of all numbers, and is the base of all number theory, with only the aberrent holding to different base number systems, like the gnoll's and their base 12. For this is is the number of Reason, and the jurors ledgers certainly obey the primacy of 10.
11. Distinctly not a power number - so some consider it inauspicious or unlucky.
12. The Number of **Passion** - as a number that can be devided so many ways, it leans into any path, where one goes to wherever one pleases. Such is passion.

...

18. Due to the spokes of the Great Wheel, many also see 18 favourably, as the sum of all fundamentals, of balance, understanding, and comprehension; and ultimately as the Number of Everything: The Universe.

## Colour Theory
Not only are there the five colours of mana: white, blue, black, red and green, a phenomenon well observed across all the materium existentiae, there are also the colours of the braid and the cosmological colours that together put semantic and psychic weight on colour and what they do, and do not, represent. The theories of colour are just as pervasive as the theories of number across the shards, lending it outside legitimacy.

The braid gives the elemental rainbow colour theory (which, depending on the Shard, is actually two competing theories). Rainbows are said to have eight or six colours, never seven, and that wind is said to be “yellow” to some (the eight colour theorists, who think green is the colour of earth) or “white” to others (the six colour theorists, who think yellow is the colour of earth). Eight-colour theorist say white is the presence of all the colours and black their absence, whereas six-colour theorists simply say black is the absence of wind. Both manage to agree that blue is water and red is fire.

The cosmological colour theory holds there are six colours. White (Good), Black (Evil), Blue (Logic), Red (Passion), Green (Reason) and Yellow (Chaos). That this clashes with the mana theorists quite awkwardly is often an area for argument, for debate is too polite and constructive a word, and neither group agrees with the rainbow theorists that black is the absence of anything, for the Shadow is most certainly an active, and not passive, force.

That their priests sold the lie of the God of Man was perhaps their greatest achievement of all, as the very perceptions of power fed the growing echoes until indeed, there was a God of Man. A shame, however, that they decided to *cast* it *out* in a fit of spite."
