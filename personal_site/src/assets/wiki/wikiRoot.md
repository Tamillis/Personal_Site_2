# Materiae Existentiae Wiki

Welcome to the Materiae Existentiae Wiki! 

MEW is an online repository for my worldbuilding project I call the 'Materiae Existentiae'

The goals of the project are:
- To provide easy access to setting information for players
- To be thoroughly cross-linked (any mention of a person, place or fact that has it's own article, will be automatically linked to)
- For previews of the articles to be accessed by middle-clicking, with previews visible within previews as deep as you want to go
- And for one day enable the addition of player-written articles, by posting to the Wiki through profiles and as their characters
