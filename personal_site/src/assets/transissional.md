# Transissionel Inglish 

### New Edition 

This is a condensed and edited version of Transissionel Inglish, effectively edition four due to the addition of fourth amendment details, presented in a more consistent and logical fashion than the initial document which was more of a design as you went mess. 

### Mission 

The mission of Transissionel Inglish is to be a writing system that provides a transition point between current English orthography, and one to one phonetic orthography (such as the I.P.A.), which can be very hard for current readers of English to understand. As such Transissionel Inglish is highly readable to current speakers (in fact all of its constructions par a few exceptions, follow common current orthographic patterns), whilst being almost perfectly decoding (i.e. it can always be read without ambiguity) and also highly consistently encoding by following a set of exclusive logical rules for determining which spelling conventions to use when. Very little knowledge of current standard English orthography is needed, though there are many pairs or triplets of conventions with the same pronunciation where current spelling is used to know which to use, for example; the ir/ur/er in “bird”, “nurse” and “verb”.  

Part of this mission included only making use of current English letters, in other words to avoid the insertion of new symbols or accents (which may put off current readers who don’t know their values). The one exception to this rule is the optional use of á, é and ú in polysyllabic words to eliminate specific cases of ambiguity where following double consonants are impossible. As such the rules that do not employ an accent always take precedent. This focus on use in-extremis also means even when in use, accents are not common.  

This document refers to original orthography as “Standard English” or “[SE]”, and prefixes any original orthography with “SE”, such as “[SE] English” vs “Inglish”. 

### Structure 

Transissionel Inglish can be learnt in three parts; the vowels, the consonants, and common constructions. 

After this a series of bulk examples are available in Transissionel Inglish, for reference. 

### Method 

- Transissionel Inglish derives its orthography from the phonetics of words as spoken in Received Pronunciation, while maintaining the rhoticity (r sound) of General American and other rhotic accents.  
- Each syllable of a word is spelled according to the following orthographic rules mostly independently of each other, and effects on pronunciation from neighbouring words (such as intrusive r) are ignored.  
- Stress patterns also follow Received Pronunciation, and need to be known in order to correctly employ schwa e.  
- Otherwise syllables are spelt on a per syllable basis. 
- Words are written as if pronounced in isolation, meaning all words have at least one strong syllable, including function words that would normally be pronounced with weak vowels while mid-sentence. 

### Syllable Structure 

All of the English language can be broken down to a series of syllables, which combine to make words, which combine to make sentences, which form the language. As stated, all spellings are derived as if their words are spoken in their “strong form”, always giving at least one strong syllable. 

Syllables in English are of the form `(C)3V(C)5` where the vowel cannot be omitted and up to three consonants can front it (the onset), and up to five consonants form its rear (the coda). Transissionel Inglish takes the stance that vocalic consonants such as l or n, consonants that function as the core vowel, as they are often pronounced in a variety of accents, are instead schwa + that consonant.  

Transissionel Inglish also takes the stance that when deciding on syllable boundaries in polysyllabic words, there is a strong onset bias, that most consonants shift to be onsets where possible. There are only coda when there is no following syllable, or making the consonants the onset of the next syllable would be illegal in English phonology (i.e. a non-pronounceable consonant cluster). So, hurry is /hʌ.ɹi/ and infuriating is /in.fʲuə.ɹɪ.ei.tiŋ/ with periods marking syllable boundaries. 

### Common Vowels 

The common vowels, as identified by their lexical sets, are used when no other rule governs the vowel sound at the heart of a syllable. This is most common in non-final syllables of polysyllabic words and monosyllabic words with no coda.  

The TRAP, DRESS and STRUT vowels make use of doubled following singular consonants to differentiate them from other vowels, hence the “(cc)” notation. If accents are in use, they are used to differentiate between the vowels when doubling the consonants is not possible, due to the absence of following consonants or the presence of a following consonant cluster. 

Short vowels; TRAP “a(cc)” or “á”, DRESS “e(cc)” or “é”, KIT “i”, LOT “o”, FOOT “u”, STRUT “u(cc)” or “ú”. 

Long vowels; BATH and PALM “a”, THOUGHT “oa” or “aw” (where SE uses an “au” or “aw”, except in cases where the next consonant is “w” again, in which case “oa” is used by default), FLEECE “y” or “ee” (where used in SE as “ee” or “ea”, or by default when fronted by the “y” consonant as in “yeeld”), GOOSE “ue” or “oo/ew” (where used in SE). 

R-coloured Vowels; START “ar”, NURSE “er” or “ir/ur” (where used in SE), FORCE and NORTH “or”. 

Diphthongs; PRICE “ai” or “ye” (where used in SE. The “e” at the end counts as a Magic E or Schwa E for suffix purposes, and may be absorbed by suffixes such as in “crying”), FACE “ei” or “ay” (where used in SE), CHOICE “oi” or “oy” (where used in SE), MOUTH “au” or “ow” (where "ow” or “ou” in SE), GOAT “ou” or “o” if there is no coda in a syllable (Motto vs. Moto GP).  

R-coloured Diphthongs; SQUARE “ear”, NEAR “iar” or “eer” (when “eer” or “ear” in SE), CURE “uar” (though speakers of the FORCE CURE merger, where those vowels are pronounced the same, can write both using “or”). 

Glide Vowels; vowels that palatalise the previous consonant, such as the difference in pronunciation between [SE] “pure” and [SE] “poor”. These are formed by “i” + the vowel, and in these cases supersede “i” as KIT or an unstressed “i”. The Glide Vowels are; 
- TUESDAY “iu” 
- PURE “iuar” 
- onIOn “ie” 

When the “iu” vowel is the entirety of a syllable (i.e. the glide has functionally become /j/), such as in [SE] "Universe”, it is instead written as “yu”, as in “Yunivers”. 

### Magic E 

Magic E is a rule learnt by children in English speaking countries at a very early age, that the e is silent and instead changes the earlier vowel into a “long vowel” as it is often called, even if there is in fact a significant change in quality as well. Magic E is arguably one of the most distinctive features of English orthography, and its maintenance in this system significantly retains readability for current readers.  

Magic E is enforced and standardised in Transissionel Inglish. It is the highest rule of the system and always takes precedence, meaning it is sometimes used in Transissionel Inglish when it is not in SE, when some other more obscure spelling or archaism is used in its place. However the use of Magic E across the board nevertheless proves to be highly readable for current speakers. The notation below uses “C” to represent any single consonant and demonstrates the structure of Magic E. As in SE, Magic E is not pronounced. 

- FACE “aCe” 
- FLEECE “eCe” 
- PRICE “iCe” 
- GOAT “oCe” 
- GOOSE “uCe” 

However, when Magic E occurs after an “r” consonant it produces the following vowels/sounds; 

- SQUARE “are” 
- NEAR “ere” 
- PRICE + schwa + r “ire” (when not using Magic E, this combination is written as “aier”) 
- FORCE “ore” 
- CURE “ure” 

Magic E is a limited rule however. The Magic E can only come after a single intervening consonant, and can only occur in the last syllable of a root word (meaning derivations don’t effect the root words use of Magic E, nor can the derivations use Magic E; “engage” and “engaged”) or the second last syllable if the last syllable contains only a schwa e in the right position (meaning after a single consonant); “pepel”.

Any suffix attached to a root word that uses a Magic E is assumed to contain the Magic E. For example; “grate” and “grater” from [SE] “great” and “greater”. Meaning it may seemingly become pronounced, though the “e” is no longer just Magic E but part of the suffix such as “er” or “ed”. 

If there is any other e of a root word following a single consonant that would look like a Magic E but is not one, such as a schwa, then this causes that single consonant to double up, including when suffixes would create a false Magic E. For example; “Meny pepel cant ete gluetten” and “betting is ilegel”. 

This consonant doubling for avoiding Magic E supersedes the consonant doubling required for the TRAP, DRESS and STRUT vowels, meaning if accents are in use then this is when they are required. For example in “pútting, as in the game of golf, and putting as in putting summthing eway”. 

### Schwa E and unstressed “i” 

Schwa is the most common sound in the English language. However, with all words always written using stressed pronunciation, the amount of schwa’s decreases significantly to polysyllabic words only.

Transision Inglish uses “e” to represent the schwa. For example, “a rumbel in the jungel” and “this , is a comme”.

In order to avoid ambiguity with Magic E and the DRESS vowel, there are the Magic E and DRESS consonant doubling rules. In addition, any “e” that occurs can be considered a schwa until some other rule takes precedence. If accents are not being used, this sometimes means it is difficult to identify DRESS vowels from schwas, a compromise which has to be made if one is adamant on avoiding accents or new letters. 

R-coloured schwa, such as with the suffix “-er”, is written as “er”, and like all suffixes starting in “e” contains a Magic E. This does not contrast with r coloured long e as in “persen". Knowledge of stress patterns needs to be had to differentiate them, just like Schwa e and the DRESS vowel. 

Unstressed “i” such as the second syllable in “Inglish”, the other weak vowel in Received Pronunciation and General American, and thus also very common, is always written as “i”. As this is of the same quality as the KIT vowel it should produce no ambiguity.

### Weak ‘Y’ 
Final syllable “y” such as in the set happY, distinctive in many accents due to tensing, is written also in Transissional Inglish as “y”, but strictly so and does not change with plural or other forms. It is also considered to contain Magic E. For example, “won baby, tue babys” and “happy lady”. As this is of the same quality of the other vowel the letter y represents, the FLEECE vowel, it also shouldn’t be a problem, and is in fact the justification for using the letter y as the single letter and standard representation for the FLEECE vowel, despite that being otherwise absent in SE. It also counts as a weak vowel for stressed vowel identification when used as part of the happY set.  

### Trisyllabic Initial Stress 

When the only stressed syllable in a trisyllabic (or more) word is the first syllable, the following syllables do not require double consonants or accents to distinguish weak vowels, as weak vowels are assumed, for example in the words “consenent” and “competent criminel”.  

### Silent and Double Letter removal 

There is a plethora of silent consonants in SE. They are removed. Silent and non-functioning vowels (i.e. non-magic E silent vowels as in [SE] “leave” or “goose”) are also removed. For example, “We thoat the ded goust flew eway,” and “he livs for lafter” 

On the other hand, any sounds not represented in SE should be added in, using their standard values. 

Any double consonants imported from SE are removed, and are only introduced (often in the same place) due to the consonant doubling rules above.  

“The bote’s hull is ful.”

### SE Consonants 

Like the vowels, consonants are written with their default values unless other rules supersede them, and their original SE consonants are ignored unless otherwise stated. 

### Common Consonants 

Consonants have their default values, as one would describe them to a young child. B for bat, C for cat (not soft c as in [SE] “cede”), D for dad, F for fan, G for girl (not soft g as in [SE] “gesture”), H for hat, J for jam, K for king, L for lamp, M for moon, N for nest, P for pet, Q for queen, R for rat, S for star, T for tea, V for van, W for win, X as in extra (or voiced version as in “exist”), Y for yes, and Z for zebra.

The uncommon consonant /ʒ/ is written as the new digraph ‘zi’ regardless of following vowels. For example, “wot a plezzier to have you rede this”.

### Common Digraphs

The common digraphs, ch, ck, ng, ph, sh, and th are retained. The digraph ‘ck’ always has the K value and is the standard value for coda /k/ and when doubling rules double ‘c’, and the digraph ‘ph’ always has the F value, but is only used when used in SE. The digraph ‘ch’ always has the value /tʃ/, so it appears as “k” otherwise; “He chose to studdy kemistry at colij” and “Cheez gave me a stummek ake”.  

The digraphs ng, sh and th have the unique values kiNG, SHeet and THing or THan respectively, like they do in SE. Like SE, Transissionel Inglish doesn’t distinguish the two pronunciations of TH, another area of accepted ambiguity (though the use of new digraph DH for voiced dental fricatives is welcome).  

### Q is strictly ‘Qu’ 

Q is only written as the digraph ‘qu’ for the sounds K+W when written so in SE, and replaced elsewhere, such as “criteke”. 

### Soft C and Hard S 

One of the largest areas of voiced unvoiced mixing is with S and Z, with C standing in for S and S for Z in SE in many situations.  

C has an S value only as an explicitly softened consonant using softening e or the rules below, which avoids there being ambiguity whilst replicating most SE spellings faithfully. Those SE spellings that follow these rules do so in Transissionel Inglish too, while those that do not conform are re-spelt according to default values as per usual, and spellings that never used these rules are spelt with default values; “sistem of servis” vs “vice sity”.  

An S that is between two vowels, a prior vowel and a Magic or schwa E, or is fronted by a nasal consonant, uses its hard pronunciation of Z; “phase, nasel, mase, taser, plese, nose, Transissional, etc”.  

When the S phoneme is needed “Soft C” is written; “face, nacell, mace, lace, pece, cloce, fence” 

In such environments where the phoneme K is needed K is used; “fake, maker, lake, cloke.” 

Note: the ‘i e y rule’ for C is not carried over from SE as it is particularly irregular in word initial positions, with the and the following ‘softened consonants’ rules recreating familiar spellings instead. It does mean SE “city” is now “sity” but such an update is fine with me.  

This is a low priority rule, ignored by standard suffixes etc. (most commonly plural and possessive s). 

### Initial C or K 

In initial position, then, C can never be soft C, it is unambigiously hard. As such both K and C have the same value. Where SE uses C, use C, where SE uses K, use K, defaulting to K; “king of the catts”, “kynwá”. 

### Softened Consonants & Softening e 

When within the final syllable the consonants C and G take on their softened form (S and J) by accepting a silent softening e, which doubles as a Magic E if there is only one consonant. For example, “hence the bage stage”.  

Additionally, a single d in before a softened g counts as a doubled consonant (and as such must not be used if the double consonant would create the wrong preceding vowel) “Don't judge fudge”.  

Like other silent e’s softening e can be absorbed into suffixes that contain Magic E or start with e. “A streinge streinger”.

If the softening e causes ambiguity with other vowels, it cannot be used. 

### Ti, si and ci 
The SE digraphs ‘ti’ ‘si’ and ‘ci’ often take on softened values due to the glide ‘i’ vowel. In Transissionel Inglish too, t or s fronting the glide vowel i are treated either as the value CH or SH respectively; “confidensiel fiutier funcsion”.  

The SE digraph ‘ci’ is ignored, written instead as “si”; “sespission”.  

The digraphs are often used in the construction ‘tion’ and ‘sion’, which especially uses “o” as the schwa. This construction can only be used in the last syllable of a word; “quesstion”. Due to this special case being a convention, it is repeated in conventions. 

The endings “sion” and “tion” function like suffixes in that they contain a Magic E. 

### U as W 
Where the letter u functions as w, as in “Languij”, then it retains its W value, unless that would introduce ambiguity with certain potential vowel combinations (namely ‘ue’), in which case w is used; “tis butt a flesh wuend” 

### Conventions 

Proper names retain original spellings, with “Transisional Inglish” being the exception for the obvious reason of marking the distinction. Though it would be nice if places decided to adopt the new conventions, as there irregularity is alarming. 

SE regular suffixes like past tense (-ed), agent marker (-er), adjective marker (-y), adverb marker (-ly) and plural (-s/-es), and others, are maintained even if the vowel or consonant is of a different phonetic value, such as /ɪ/, and also count as automatically containing a Magic E, schwa e or softening e if there’s a silent e in the ending of the presuffixed word. 

Apostrophes for shortened words are no longer used, but are for possessive ‘s. Note this will inverse the [SE] “its vs it’s” rule: ‘Thats it's folt but its OK’. 

Only proper nouns and sentence starting words retain capitalization. 

As already implied by the rules so far, any instance of consonant + schwa that is pronounced schwa + consonant, is instead written as schwa + consonant in the American fashion. For example, “senter of the bottel”. 

Derivative words do not maintain the spelling of the root word. The derivative is spelled using TI conventions for the pronunciation of the derived word; “photo, phetoggrepher”.

The construcitons ‘tion’ and ‘sion’ especially use “o” as the schwa. This construction can only be used in the last syllable of a word; “quesstion”. 

Unless otherwise noted, punctuation and other conventions are retained. 

### Accepted Irregular Spellings 

The following root words retain their [SE] spellings, due to their frequency and relatively low number these exceptions should become easy to read for new readers through traditional rote memorisation, but due to their irregularity and frequency the maintenance of these old spellings greatly improves readability for current readers: 

A, and, at, be, by, do, go, have, he, I, of, off, she, they,  to, up, we, what, when, where, which, who, why, you.  

All of their derivative words (such as plural forms, possessive forms, past forms, perfect forms and any others) also maintain their [SE] irregular spellings. 

## Example Texts 

The following are some example bulk texts of Transission Inglish. Current readers should have little to no trouble reading it, and get the rhythm of the new rules fairly quickly and intuitively, whilst new readers can learn the consistent system of rules and spellings far more easily than current readers learnt SE. 

### The North Wind and The Sun 

The North Wind and the Sunn were dispiuting which was the stronger, when a travveler came elong rapped in a worm cloke. They egreed that the won who first secseeded in making the travveler take his cloke off shud be censiddered stronger than the úther. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he cud, butt the more he blew the more clocely did the travveler fold his cloke erownd him; and at last the North Wind gave up the etémpt. Then the Sunn shon owt wormly, and imydietly the travveler tuk off his cloke. And so, the North Wind was obliged to cenfess that the Sunn was the stronger of the tue. 
 

### Schleicher’s Fable 

On a hil, a sheep that had no wul saw horses, won of them pulling a hevy waggen, won carrying a big lode, and won carrying a man quickly. The sheep sed to the horses: "My hart panes me, seeing a man driving horses." The horses sed: "Lissen, sheep, our harts pane us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wul of the sheep into a worm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wul." Having herd this, the sheep fled into the plane.
