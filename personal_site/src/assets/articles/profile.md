## Introduction

*[23<sup>rd</sup> June 2023]*

Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, as you might have already seen on the landing page's faux-terminal. 

I'm a C# ASP.NET Trainer at Sparta Global, training cohorts of fresh-faced devs and testers C#, .NET, and a host of tools and frameworks to be effective on-site devs and testers after only 2 months of gruelling and intense training. 

I'm also a self-taught Full Stack developer (currently my stack being Vue, raw PHP [with some Laravel historically], and MySQL); a former English Foreign Language teacher of 6 years; a fluent speaker of Japanese (having worked as a translator) and conversational Swedish speaker, and dabbler in many other various languages. 

Personally, I'm a happily married man to a lovely wife, a world traveller (places I've been in highlighted red on the globe there) and a massive Dungeons & Dragons geek, primarily in the role as forever-DM (so please let me know if you need a player!). 

As you can probably see, I'm also a corgi owner and dog-person.

I like to call myself a generalist. With a wide base of skills to pull on, I am capable of quickly and efficiently learning new skills or applying skills to new areas of work. I have a strong scientific background while also being capable and experienced in the humanities, where I have many years of professional experience. Now, I also have a strong technical capability and depth of knowledge. I strongly believe; the power of a generalist is the ability to specialise anywhere. 

If you have any questions or enquiries, please feel free to contact me via e-mail or on LinkedIn (links in sidebar).

## Qualifications & Education
### *The official certificates and education that I possess.*

- _**ISTQB® Certified Tester**_: while working with Sparta Global I earned the ISTQB® Certified Tester qualification to teach it to our trainees, which is an industry standard in software testing and a major feature of our C# and Java Test courses. It provides a thorough framework to express testing concepts and be that common language between all people involved in testing, which in any good project is near everyone.

- An _**OCR Level 3 Diploma in Business Administration**_ during a commercial business apprenticeship with ZF Friedrichshafen AG, educated by Solihull College, where I developed a wide base of business skills alongside practical experience managing accounts of cart part manufacturing and supply for various big-names; Jaguar Landrover, Honda, Toyota and others. (Oct 2017 – Oct 2018)

- A _**Trinity College London TESOL**_ certificate for teaching English as a foreign language, received from Universal Language Training, a 6 month course condensed into the busiest 1 month of my life. Well worth it, however, and it sparked my passion for teaching. (July 2015)

- A _**Certificate of Higher Education in Physics**_ from Royal Holloway University of London’s physics department. (September 2012 – June 2015)

For a complete list of my secondary education please contact me.

## Personal Skills
### *The skills and abilities I bring to a table that haven't been printed on a paper first.*

_**Teaching and Training, Leadership and Teamwork**_: for six years since leaving University I've travelled the world and taught. Now I work at Sparta Global as a trainer teaching trainees how to become business level software engineers using C# and .NET. Teaching is a career that is incredibly rewarding and uniquely positioned to help people, not because they are in need, but because they wish to learn. I'm always honoured to have such a privilage. It also furnishes me with strong leadership and team skills, soft skills and a rock-solid knowledge basis. You cannot teach something well without really knowing it.

_**Programming, Software Development**_: in no particular order, I am capable of coding in C#, .NET, Laravel, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL (MySQL, SQLite, ANSI etc), React, Vue, Java, Basic, Python, Node.js, Apache, Nginx, and even a little C++. I'm confident I can quickly pick up any other programming language. I've used these both solo and as part of a team using Git version control and Agile development, with Scrum and Kanban techniques, to produce websites, applications, APIs and test frameworks.

I'm a stickler for best practices, such as SOLID, Design Patterns (used appropriately!), DRY & DAMP, and especially KISS. Any software or framework I need to learn to produce projects I'm happy to do, and I love to work at a project from ideation to deployment.

Whilst primarily a Windows 10 user (11 when I must), I'm also very comfortable on Linux (both Debian and Arch based distros), as a desktop or as a headless server interacting purely through the terminal and bash scripting. Putting Lubuntu on an old Windows Surface Pro was a fun project I underwent once. I also build computers as a hobby, and know them literally inside and out.  My personal computer is a Frankensteinian creation of parts that have gone through a steady cycle of upgrades, and the chip price hikes really hurt me.

_**Languages**_: Another passion of mine, I speak Japanese fluently, Swedish conversationally and I'm working on French. I hold a JLPT N1 level equivalent level of Japanese, conversing at a native level (literally at a business level for the last 3 years), and a B1+ (CEFR) level in Swedish. Through past endeavours I in theory also have a foundational understanding of Spanish, German, Chinese, Russian, Esperanto and academic linguistics.


***Public Facing***: from working in a 5-star hotel, to presenting language workshops to members of the public, to liaising with clients, I am unfailingly polite and communicate well, having honed many other people and soft skills extensively in the teaching industry. I pride myself on my professional attitude in work, and my charming and approachable manner.

***Media Production***: in my most recent position I have been heavily involved in producing professional quality educational videos for internal and external use, producing the entire process of scripting, filming and editing. I have also written articles to be published by the company for tech interest.

*Dates:* May 2022 to present

*Company*: Sparta Global

*Job Title:* Junior Trainer

*Details of position:* I teach the C# Developer and C# SDET / Testing Automation courses, taking groups through an intensive 2 months of training and teaching them from practically zero programming skill to business level competence able to produce and test APIs and Web Apps running on ASP.NET.

Over the course of the project the client is consulted and adaptions are made, until the site can be deployed.

Having already visited the country in summer in the very hot and humid Kyoto for a month, this time I wanted a winter adventure. Not sure when I would be leaving, I bought a one way ticket. In the end I found a company willing to sponsor me for a visa to be a teacher, the same company in fact that I had studied at, and so changed my life.

### _**Travelling in Sweden**_

*Dates*: November 2018

*Details of travel*: Having worked in a typical multinational company for a year I was desperate to go back to teaching, but also to really experience Sweden by living there.

In the end I came home.

This method affords me a complete technical understanding of English grammar as well as the ability to easily and clearly communicate and teach to others, regardless of their native language and English ability, as well as teaching other skills and effectively communicate ideas. I was also often responsible for extra classes in local schools, at no extra charge, and was in charge of pronunciation education across the area.
