## Introduction

*[9<sup>th</sup> May 2024]*

Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, as you might have already seen on the landing page's faux-terminal. 

I'm the C# ASP.NET Web Developer & System Administrator at Downey Designs bespoke jewellery makers. I also train others in how to program in C# up to and including deploying websites during the weekends at [ClassGap](https://www.classgap.com/me/peter-bellaby) as a side gig.

I was formerly a trainer at Sparta Global, where I trained cohorts of fresh-faces, most of whom have only a smidgen of programming experience, to become industry-standard developers and automation testers in C#, .NET, and a host of tools and frameworks. The goal of the course is to get students to become effective on-site team members after only 2 months of gruelling and intense training. 

I'm also a self-taught:
- a Full Stack developer (currently my stack being Vue, raw PHP [with some Laravel historically], and MySQL)
- a former English Foreign Language teacher of 6 years, living and working in Spain, Slovakia, the UK, Sweden and Japan
- a fluent speaker of Japanese (having worked as a translator) and conversational Swedish speaker, and dabbler in many other various languages

Personally, I'm a happily married man to a lovely wife, a world traveller (places I've been in highlighted red on the globe there) and a massive Dungeons & Dragons geek, primarily in the role as forever-DM (so please let me know if you need a player!). This goes some-way in explaining most of the content of this site, I'm sure.

As you can probably see in my picture, I'm also a corgi owner and dog-person.

I like to call myself a generalist. With a wide base of skills to pull on, I am capable of quickly and efficiently learning new skills or applying skills to new areas of work. I have a strong scientific background, having studied Physics at Universtiy, while also being capable and experienced in the humanities, where I have many years of professional experience. Now, I also have a strong technical capability and depth of knowledge as a programmer. I strongly believe that the power of a generalist is the ability to specialise anywhere.

If you have any questions or enquiries, please feel free to contact me via e-mail at [peter@bellaby.co.uk](mailto:peter@bellaby.co.uk) or on LinkedIn (links in sidebar).

## Qualifications & Education
### *The official certificates and education that I possess, in order of recency.*

- _**ISTQB® Certified Tester**_: while working with Sparta Global I earned the ISTQB® Certified Tester qualification to teach it to our trainees, which is an industry standard in software testing. It provides a thorough framework to express testing concepts and be a common language for use between all people involved in testing, which in any good project is near everyone. (November 2022)

- An _**OCR Level 3 Diploma in Business Administration**_ during a commercial business apprenticeship with ZF Friedrichshafen AG, educated by Solihull College, where I developed a wide base of business skills alongside practical experience managing accounts of cart part manufacturing and supply for various big-names; Jaguar Landrover, Honda, Toyota and others. (Oct 2017 – Oct 2018)

- A _**Trinity College London TESOL**_ certificate for teaching English as a foreign language, received from Universal Language Training, a 6 month course condensed into the busiest 1 month of my life. Well worth it, however, and it sparked my passion for teaching. (July 2015)

- A _**Certificate of Higher Education in Physics**_ from Royal Holloway University of London’s physics department. (September 2012 – June 2015)

For a complete list of my secondary education please contact me.

## Personal Skills
### *The skills and abilities I bring to a table that haven't been printed on a paper first.*

_**Teaching and Training**_: for six years since leaving University I've travelled the world and taught. That was followed by a year working at Sparta Global as a trainer teaching students how to become business level software engineers using C# and .NET: and I continue training free-lance part-time through "ClassGap.com". Teaching is a career that is incredibly rewarding and uniquely positioned to help people who wish to learn. It also furnishes me with strong leadership and team skills, soft skills and a rock-solid knowledge basis. You cannot teach something well without really knowing it.

_**Programming, IT & Web Development**_: I'm an IT & system administrator capable of coding in wide array of languages (see the home page's carousel banner) as well as running and outfitting a business' IT needs from phones to servers. I professionally use C# .NET with Razor pages, SQL Server, Vue and my own custom JavaScript framework I call TableMaker. I'm confident I can quickly pick up any other programming language or framework. I've worked solo and as part of a team, using Git version control and Agile development, with Scrum and Kanban techniques, to produce websites, applications, APIs and test frameworks.

I'm a stickler for best practices, such as SOLID, Design Patterns (used appropriately!), DRY & DAMP, and especially KISS. Any software or framework I need to learn to produce projects I'm happy to do, and I though I love to work at a project from ideation to deployment, I'm also confident and practiced in picking up code and handing it over to the next hand in the chain.

Whilst primarily a Windows user, I'm also very comfortable on Linux (both Debian and Arch based distros), as a desktop or as a headless server interacting purely through the terminal and bash scripting. Putting Lubuntu on an old Windows Surface Pro was a fun project I underwent once. I also build computers as a hobby, and know them literally inside and out.  My personal computer is a Frankensteinian creation of parts that have gone through a steady cycle of upgrades.

_**Languages**_: Another passion of mine, I speak Japanese fluently, Swedish conversationally and I'm working on French. I hold a JLPT N1 level equivalent level of Japanese, conversing at a native level (and at a business level for 3 years), and a B1+ (CEFR) level in Swedish. Through past endeavours I in theory also have a foundational understanding of Spanish, German, Esperanto and linguistics.

***Public Facing***: from working in a 5-star hotel, to presenting workshops to members of the public, to liaising with clients to design websites, I am unfailingly polite and communicate well, having honed many other people and soft skills extensively in the teaching industry and in business. I pride myself on my professional attitude in work, and my charming and approachable manner.

***Media Production***: in my previous position at Sparta I have been heavily involved in producing professional quality educational videos for internal and external use, producing the entire process of scripting, filming and editing. I have also written articles to be published by the company for tech interest.
