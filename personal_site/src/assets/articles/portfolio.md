## Professional Work

Professsionally, I've worked as a developer since just before returning to the UK in 2022. If you want to know more about my professional career and personal travels, please see [my about page](/about).

I am the sole developer for Downey Designs Ltd. here in the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham, ensuring both steady progress and modernisation of the site, new features, bug fixes and system maintenance. A large part of the latter is administration of the remote Windows Server we run through HostingUK, and all other IT tasks here in the office. As such I spend just as much of my time in Visual Studio coding c# as a I do writing SQL queries on the database; managing accounts and access in Microsoft 364 Admin; installing, uninstalling and setting up software and hardware in the office (phones, computers, scanners etc...); and much more.

The main thrust of my role is in creating new and replacement pages for the website (which doubles as our store-front presence as well as internal administraiton platform) from older versions at various stages of .NET history, in order to one-day transition to modern .NET (that would be, at time of writing, .NET8).

Before this, I worked as a C# trainer at Sparta Global, where I taught others the techniques of development (and automated testing). Working at Sparta Global, as a trainee and primarily as a trainer, I was involved in many demonstration projects for the various cohorts who were producing them to demonstrate their skills practically. 

Unfortunately all of the above is not something that can be shown. My SpartaGlobal account has since become inaccessible to me and for security reasons the pricate repo for my current work is not something I will share. As such, I've decided to put together a few publically available demo projects, providing a link to my public github repositories.

## Github Projects

### This Site ("Personal Site 2")

The immediate and most illuminating project is the repo for this site itself! It is of course supposed to be a demonstration of my skills, as the landing page's terminal described. It began life as a demonstration of my free-lance learning, and therefore my ability with my chosen stack: VueJS, PHP and MySQL. 

It has been steadily worked on ever since (mostly as a vehicle for my own personal projects in my personal life, such as my own version of D&D [PEDD](/PEDD) and my worldbuilding [mewiki](/mewiki)). It also makes use of a python script that is my own simple CMS, exposing server-hosted markdown files (this very portfolio is written in markdown), as well as plenty of JSON and other JS libraries (Marked, Three, P5 etc.).

Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/Tamillis/Personal_Site_2).

### My Tools

This repository hosts my own custom JavaScript framework, as well as a number of smaller projects I've used professionally. It primarily demonstrates my fluency in vanilla javascript, but also my ability to tackle and produce complex tools that I actually use on a daily basis.

Tablemaker.js is the most important of these tools (the above mentioned framework), which is designed to easily produce DOM elements to represent and manipulate tabular JSON data.

Find it [Here](https://github.com/Tamillis/MyTools) and the Tablemaker README specifically [Here](https://github.com/Tamillis/MyTools/blob/main/TableMaker/README.md).

### Salvage Union Character Sheet

Hosted on the [/SalvageUnion](/SalvageUnion) endpoint, this page demonstrates my Vue skill with a more complex form that stores its data dynamically in the URL (for storage-less storage and the ability to easily save and share your character sheet with friends).

It is hosted [~Here~ (To be transfered over)]()

### PostIt

PostIts is a demonstration of the core capabilities that I would teach others to have (combining both the C# Developer and C# Automation Tester streams). Using C# ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server, NUnit, SpecFlow, Razor pages and SOLID programming practices. It also demonstrations techniques like the creation of a service layer (to allow for better testing) as well as integration testing through Selenium, a web scraper that'll test the site itself, and Postman to test the API calls.

The site itself is supposed to be a simple clone of twitter, allowing users to register, log in, make posts that will be seen by others, comment on others' posts and like / unlike posts. The main posts are also ordered based on an *algorithm* (it's very simple, a weighting of recency and number of likes only ^^).

Greater detail, and an in-depth walkthrough of the process of creation by following a particular User Story from inception to implementation, can be read in the README of the project.

### 4x44

A JavaScript demonstration and hobby game project that I will have hosted on this site right here, no less! Current state of the project [here](https://github.com/Tamillis/4x44)
