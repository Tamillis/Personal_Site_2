## The Work I've Done

Since working at Sparta Global, as a trainee and primarily as a trainer, I've been involved in many demonstration projects that have since become inaccessible to me. As such, from memory, I've decided to put together a demo project, and also provide a link to my public github repositories (where this site's source code can also be found) here as well, alongside my other portfolio-functioning projects.

### PostIt

PostIts is a demonstration of the core capabilities that I would teach others to have (combining both the C# Developer and C# Automation Tester streams). Using C# ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server, NUnit, SpecFlow, Razor pages and SOLID programming practices. It also demonstrations techniques like the creation of a service layer (to allow for better testing) as well as integration testing through Selenium, a web scraper that'll test the site itself, and Postman to test the API calls.

The site itself is supposed to be a simple clone of twitter, allowing users to register, log in, make posts that will be seen by others, comment on others' posts and like / unlike posts. The main posts are also ordered based on an *algorithm* (it's very simple, a weighting of recency and number of likes only ^^).

Greater detail, and an in-depth walkthrough of the process of creation by following a particular User Story from inception to implementation, can be read in the README of the project.

### 4x44

A JavaScript demonstration and hobby game project that I will have hosted on this site right here, no less! Current state of the project [here](https://github.com/Tamillis/4x44)

### This Site

This site itself is of course supposed to be a demonstration of my skills, as the landing page's terminal described. It is a demonstration of my Free-lance times, and therefore my ability with my chosen stack: VueJS, PHP and MySQL. It also makes use of a python script that is my own simple CMS, exposing server-hosted markdown files (this very portfolio is written in markdown!), as well as plenty of JSON and other JS libraries (Marked, Three, P5 etc.).

Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/Tamillis/Personal_Site_2).
