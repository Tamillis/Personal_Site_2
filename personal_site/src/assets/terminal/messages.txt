Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, and this is my website, resume and personal portfolio. 
It's here to display my various projects, passions and business information. 
This site is built primarily with JavaScript (Vue, marked, p5, three, plotly), a smidge of python, and the api at /surveydata with php
For example, the fractal snowflake storm that runs seemlessly behind every page is the power of P5JS and Vue working together. 
Feel free to inspect the sourcecode, and other projects, at my github: https://github.com/tamillis/
