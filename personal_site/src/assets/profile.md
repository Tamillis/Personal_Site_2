## Introduction

*[Updated 11<sup>th</sup> September 2022]*

Hi, my name is Peter Bellaby, as you might have already seen on the landing page's mock terminal. 

I'm a C# Trainer at Sparta Global, and also a self-taught Full Stack developer, a former English Foreign Language teacher, a fluent speaker of Japanese and dabbler in various other languages, a happily married man to a lovely wife, a world traveller (places I've been in highlighted red on the globe there) and a massive Dungeons & Dragons geek, primarily in the role as forever-DM (so please let me know if you need a player!) As you can probably see, I'm also a corgi owner and dog-person.

Programming is one of my passions and the internet is my second home. Before becoming a trainer at SpartaGlobal, I freelanced web development which I'd entirely taught to myself using free resources on the internet. I'm sure I still make many common mistakes on that front!

I also used to teach English as a secondary language in the northern island of Hokkaido in Japan, as well as doing translation and various other odd jobs here and there to do with languages or computers, or both.

I've taught ever since completing a TESOL course after graduation from Royal Holloway University of London, where I studied
Physics at an undergraduate level.

I’m aware that my focus is pretty scattered, but I like to consider myself a generalist able to tackle and take
on any kind of task and excel. A generalist is someone who can specialise anywhere.

If you have any questions or enquiries, please feel free to contact me via e-mail (link in sidebar) or <a href="skype:p.t.bellaby?userinfo" class="intext-link" target="_blank">here</a> on Skype or

## Qualifications & Education
### *The official certificates and education that I possess.*

- _**ISTQB Certification**_: while working with SpartaGlobal I teach the ISTQB Certificate in testing, which is an industry standard in software testing and a major feature of our SDET C# and Java courses. It provides a thorough framework to express testing concepts and be that common language between all people involved in testing, which in any good project is near everyone.

- _**Full-stack Web Development**_: where I taught myself using online tools and
practice over the course of half a year, building on a foundation of hobbyist interest in programming since university. This site is the proof of that.

- An _**OCR Level 3 Diploma in Business Administration**_ during a commercial business apprenticeship with ZF Friedrichshafen AG, educated by Solihull College, where I developed a wide base of business skills alongside practical experience managing accounts of cart part manufacturing and supply for various big-names; Jaguar Landrover, Honda, Toyota and others. (Oct 2017 – Oct 2018)

- A _**Trinity College London TESOL**_ certificate for teaching English as a foreign language, received from Universal Language Training, a 6 month course condensed into the busiest 1 month of my life. Well worth it, however, and it sparked my passion for teaching. (July 2015)

- A _**Certificate of Higher Education in Physics**_ from Royal Holloway University of London’s physics department. (September 2012 – June 2015)

## Personal Skills
### *The skills and abilities I bring to a table that haven't been printed on a paper first.*

_**Teaching**_: for six years since leaving University I've travelled the world and taught. Now I work at SpartaGlobal as a trainer teaching trainees how to become business level software engineers using C# and .NET. Teaching is a career that is incredibly rewarding and uniquely positioned to help people, not because they are in need, but because they wish to learn. I'm always honoured to have such a privilage.

_**Programming, Software Development**_: in no particular order, I am capable of coding in C#, .NET, Laravel, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, React, Vue, Java, Basic, Python, and even a little C++. I'm confident I can quickly pick up any other programming language. I've used these both solo and as part of a team using Git version control and AGILE development techniques to produce websites, applications and test frameworks.

I'm a stickler for best practices, such as SOLID, DRY, KISS and YAGNI. Any software or framework I need to learn to produce projects I'm happy to do, and I love to work at a project from ideation to deployment.

Whilst primarily a Windows 10 user (11 when I must), I've also flirted with Linux (both Debian and Arch based distros) and putting Lubuntu on an old Windows Surface Pro was a fun project I underwent once. I also build computers as a hobby, and know them literally inside and out.  My personal computer is a frankenstein creation of parts that have gone through a steady cycle of upgrades, and the chip shortage really hurts me.

_**Languages**_: Another passion of mine, I speak Japanese fluently, Swedish conversationally and I'm working on French. I hold a JLPT N1 level equivalent level of Japanese, conversing at a native level (literally at a business level for the last 3 years), and a B1+ (CEFR) level in Swedish. Through past endeavours I in theory also have a foundational understanding of Spanish, German, Esperanto and academic linguistics.


I have _**Public liason experience**_. I worked as a waiter in a 5-star hotel for a year
and in various London-wide events as event staff while studying at university. Thanks to this experience I learned to be unfailingly polite, and honed many other soft skills. I pride myself on my professional attitude in work.

### A Generalist
I have a wide base of skills to pull on and am capable of quickly and efficiently learning new skills or applying skills to new areas of work. I have a strong scientific background while also being capable and experienced in the humanities, where I have spent most of my working life. I firmly believe the power of a generalist is the ability to specialise anywhere.

*Job Title:* Teaching Assistant for the C# Stream

*Details of position:* I train new spartan cohorts in the C# Streams, both development and SDET, getting them up to snuff to become valuable consultants to our clients across the country and making them invaluable members that after their 2 year contracts clients are happy to take on as permenant employees.

Over the course of the project the client is consulted and adaptions are made, until the site can be deployed.

Having already visited the country in summer in the very hot and humid Kyoto for a month, this time I wanted a winter adventure. Not sure when I would be leaving, I bought a one way ticket. In the end I found a company willing to sponsor me for a visa to be a teacher, the same company in fact that I had studied at, and so changed my life.

### _**Travelling in Sweden**_

*Dates*: November 2018

*Details of travel*: Having worked in a typical multinational company for a year I was desperate to go back to teaching, but also to really experience Sweden by living there. With that in mind, I decided to job hunt on site and also visit old friends and new, and brush up on my language skills. I travelled from Uppsala to Gothenberg, and it's a month I will not forget. In the end I came home.

This method affords me a complete technical understanding of English grammar as well as the ability to easily and clearly communicate and teach to others, regardless of their native language and English ability, as well as teaching other skills and effectively communicate ideas. I was also often responsible for extra classes in local schools, at no extra charge, and was in charge of pronunciation education across the area.
