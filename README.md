# Personal_Site_2
Version 2 of the ol' personal portfolio site at [bellaby.co.uk](https://bellaby.co.uk)

## Version 2 Raison D'Ãªtre
The old site was a mish-mash of html, php and even a cute demonstration of react, vue and database work.

I've naturally grown (at least a little) since then so I'm porting the site over to this project, a rewrite in my favourite JS framework, VueJS (specifically Vue3 using composition API because god why would you use options) as a Single Page Application using Vue-Router. Also, I'm steadily in the process of actually managing my content sanely, keeping things simple with markdown files and markedjs.

The rewrite is an active process, so please understand that some pages are missing compared to the old website (notably database interaction and visitor survey), but already the site is much **much** better for me as a developer to work with.
